My team is hiring developers in the high-scale data space that have experience building data and analytics pipelines. The ideal candidate is someone with a deep understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lamda architecture</a> and has built production systems with it. Experience with NoSQL databases, Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Serverless, Containers, and Kubernetes are the norm for this role. Experience with Azure data services such as Cosmos DB, Azure Data Lake, and Azure Stream Analytics are a bonus.</p>
<p>Our team is called Commercial Software Engineering and our mission is to help customers innovate with Azure. We do that via direct engagements where we code side-by-side with customers on their specific scenarios. For example, right now my team is working with a select few customers on the IoT Edge v2 product that is currently in private preview. We code with the customers, get their feedback to the engineering team and develop stop gaps that enable their scenarios. A win-win for us is when the customer is able to innovate on their scenarios with Azure and the engineering team is able to improve their services based on customer feedback. We then share all of this innovation and learnings via GitHub, Microsoft Docs, Blogs and Conferences.</p>
<p>This role is unique because it is a hybrid engineering role that enables you to have direct access to customers and code alongside them. Before joining this team, I was a product developer for 18 years and didn’t have much direct exposure to the users of my applications or services. This role puts you right into the thick of it with customers. Your impact is measured by how you help customers develop with Microsoft services and also how you influence engineering teams to build services based on customer needs. It’s a great role for engineers that love to code, but also don’t want to code all-day-every-day on the same product. There’s a lot of variety here and you get exposed to so many high-scale scenarios that force you to grow your skillset. I have learned more about cloud services and architecture in this role than any other role. Rather than spending years on a service like Power BI or Bing, I’ve spend a lot of time building complete cloud scenarios that involve all aspects of cloud solutions, from ingestion, to analytics and continuous delivery.</p>
<p>If this role sounds interesting to you, then I highly encourage you to apply. If you aren’t ready to apply and just have some questions, you can also send me an <a href="http://bit.ly/emailjon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email to chat</a>.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relo to Redmond area is highly recommended for this role.</li>
<li>Travel will be required, but we let you manage based on your comfort level.</li>
