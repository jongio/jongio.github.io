I’m a big believer in mentorship because I’m a byproduct of many patient mentors. I wouldn’t be close to where I am today without them. With every job I’ve ever had, I’ve been fortunate enough to have someone take me under their wing and show me the ropes in my early years and help me mature in these later years. Too often these days, I talk with people that need mentors, but they don’t have one, don’t know how to find one, and don’t know where to start. I don’t think it has to do with pride, because they want to grow and need someone to speak truth into their lives. There are so many seasoned people out there that would make great mentors and so many mentees that need their help, but they aren’t connected. The effects of a good mentor are not celebrated enough and the result is a generation of people left to their own devices and aren’t growing as quickly as they could. I would love to see a mentorship revival - especially in the tech industry - where everyone is your competitor - and everyone is the smartest person in the room. It’s time to swallow our pride and reach out to those more experienced than us and ask for help. By not having a mentor, you are saying you don’t want unbiased guidance that will accelerate your growth and help you through the most challenging times in your career. The only thing that is stopping you is the right motive and tools. Mentors are the behind-the-scenes people that take you under their wing because they see your potential and want to contribute to your growth. A great mentor is comfortable being your “dutch uncle” and will tell you exactly what they think, even if it is uncomfortable; they always tell it like they see it. We need people like that in our lives to help accelerate our growth. A mentor is someone that you can be vulnerable with, trust to not judge you too harshly, and provide you with strategies that you would have never thought of on your own. From the mentor’s perspective, having a mentee stretches you to effectively communicate what you’ve learned over the years and enables you to have significant impact in the lives of others. The only two things you need to be a mentor or mentee are a growth mindset and time. When you have a growth mindset, you are open to learning about yourself and others and are always looking for ways to improve. It may not be obvious, but having a growth mindset also means that you are dedicated to helping others in their growth. Having time is a tough one, we’re all busy, but I bet you can spare 30 minutes a month to have meaningful and lasting impact on someone else’s career and life. I recommend at least two mentors, one from your immediate team and one from outside your team, and at least one mentee. The “mentor on your team” has context into the people and projects you are working on and can give you anecdotal recommendations and feedback based on their first-hand observations. If there isn’t anyone on your team that could be your mentor, then look harder, ask your manager for a reference. If you still come up empty then maybe it is time to move on to a different team or company because you might be the smartest and most experienced person in the room. If you can’t learn from anyone on the team, then you are likely stunting your growth. It is essential that you surround yourself with people that are smarter than you - people that will raise the bar of the entire team, including you. Ideally, one mentor on your team is your manager and you can trust them enough to talk about anything without it impacting your performance reviews. If you don’t have that relationship with your manager, then give it time and try to intentionally develop that trust. If it’s not there after a while, then maybe it is time to find a different manager, or look elsewhere for your mentorship needs. Whatever your strategy is, definitely have someone on your team that you can go to for help. The “mentor outside your team”, should be someone that has the type of job you want in a few years or someone you look up to. The reason why we want a mentor outside of your team is because they don’t have context and can give you an unbiased opinion without any of the politics. Your ideal mentor might be out of reach at your current stage - i.e. the CEO isn’t likely to be your mentor if you are a junior developer, so start lower in the hierarchy if need be. Either way, aim as high as you feel comfortable and work your way around until you find the right match. Most of the time all you have to do is introduce yourself, tell them you would like some advice, and see if they have time to grab coffee and chat. I’m always open to doing that and I think most others would be as well. Just keep in mind that these folks are busy as well and most of them I know are open to occasional chats, but don’t have cycles to commit to a formal mentoring relationship on a regular basis. Some people just prefer a coffee chat as needed - so discuss that with them and figure out what is best for them. If you are a lead or a manager, then the mentee part is easy because those people report to you. But be open to mentoring other people outside of your team as well. Having a growth mindset also means that you support others in their growth. If you don’t have time, then you can always refer them to someone else on your team or another colleague. If you aren’t in a leadership role, then look around for more junior folks on your team or sister teams. Discuss the mentorship opportunity with your manager and their manager. Let them know that you are open to mentoring and ask them to keep an eye out for people that you can help. Get on a project with them, see where they need help, and provide them with guidance and support. Even if you are a new college hire, get into the habit of being a mentor by finding an intern you can coach. For managers, I recommend putting effort into bootstrapping mentoring on your team. This means being on the lookout for people that can use a mentor or a mentee and making a connection between the two. I start by individually talking to everyone on my team and let them know my mentoring philosophy. I then let them know who on the team I think they could learn from and ask if they are okay either being a specific person’s mentor and being another specific person’s mentee. Here’s an example of how this recently played out on our team. A developer from a sister team has been helping my team with a bunch of projects. This person was receiving glowing feedback from everyone that worked with them. That is excellent and I’m proud of them for doing so well. But, my natural inclination, when I hear “nothing but glowing feedback”, is that the person needs to be promoted, challenged and pushed out of their comfort zone. We all have room for improvement. I had a one-on-one with them and asked them what they wanted to do with their career. They said the only thing they want to do right now is create, learn and grow as a developer. They will grow just by being around the other folks on the team, but there’s an opportunity here to accelerate their growth by intentionally setting them up with a mentor on the team. Someone that has many more years of experience and has worked on high-scale services. I explicitly told them who I wanted them to seek feedback from and be open to direct feedback from him at any time. I also explicitly told the mentor that I wanted him to help them grow. Both of them benefit and it only required me to make the connection. I’ve also instilled in the more senior folks that they are to be the patient leader who listens to others complete thoughts, without cutting them off, and helps the team strive to make significant impact through a common vision and shared goals. As a more experienced person, it is easy to forget that we were just starting out not too long ago and lots of people have invested in us. It’s our duty to do the same for others. I’ve seen mentorship decline in our industry and I want help do something about it. I’ve seen the process above help: have two mentors, one on your team, one not on your team and have at least one mentee. Be assertive in your quest to find a great mentor - ask your manager for help if you need it. If you are a manager, when you see an opportunity, assign explicit mentor/mentee relationships on your team. Hold each of them accountable to be honest with each other and support them in having each other’s best interest in mind and check in with them regularly. Now, go get a mentor or two and say “yes” to requests for advice and coffee.

If you remove system.serviceModel from Azure.Function.Cli.dll.config you will see a generic Object reference not set to an instance of an object error. The bottom line is that ConfigurationManager is no longer supported, you have to use the new ASPNET Core Configuration system. Here’s how to do that in Azure Function v2.

It’s called Azure IoT Edge Dev Tool (PyPI, GitHub, Video) and helps IoT Edge developers with inner loop dev tasks (dev, test, debug, build, push, release). This post is less about the actual pip package and more about my experience building and distributing one. Coding in Python is easy. Distributing it as a Python package is hard. 5% of the effort is coding. 95% of the effort goes into figuring out how to distribute the thing. I spent so many hours struggling through this on my own that I had to share to hopefully save you some ticks. Let’s jump right in. Python Version 2 or 3 My project works with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6, but I should have only coded it for Python 3. If you don’t absolutely need to support Python 2.7, then don’t. I spent way too much time debugging issues that worked on one version but not the other. I’m building a proof-of-concept package, so I could easily ask my users to install Python 3. In more official organization supported packages, you might not have that luxury. Isolate Installs with Virtual Environments I just jumped right in to writing Python code and didn’t realize the concept of Virtual Environments existed in Python. In a nutshell, it allows you to isolate pip installs from other pip installs, so you avoid versioning conflicts with global packages. You can read more about them here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html Python Package Scaffold: Cookiecutter I discovered Cookiecutter, the Python package project scaffolding tool, about half way through the creation of my pip package. I wish I would have known about it earlier, because it is really helpful. It will scaffold out an entire project for you with unit tests, Travis integration, setuptools and so on. I used the Cookiecutter PyPackage template, but you can find a lot more of them here: A Pantry Full of Cookiecutters Create Project pip install -U cookiecuttercookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git Project Name I wanted to use iotedgedev as my PyPI name and GitHub repo and I also wanted iotedgedev to be the command line name. The cookiecutter template didn’t allow that directly so I had to make a few manual edits. I created a project named iotedgedev and then made these changes: In setup.py changed setup(name=&quot;iotedgedev&quot;) In .travis.yml and travis_pypi_setup.py changed iotedgedev to iotedgedev Reserve Your Project Name on both PyPI Test and PyPI Production Environments PyPI Test(https://test.pypi.org) and PyPI Production(https://pypi.org) have different backends, so you need to register your project name with both of them. Do this immediately after you decide on a name, because someone could register it or you could run into an issue like I did, where I was getting a ]403 because someone already registered the name against the PyPI Test environment](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/4607). PyPI was able to resolve the issue - but you might not be able to. Reserve your names. Testing: Tox and unittest The template I chose uses Tox and unittest (not pytest) so I just went with that. The tests are in the tests folder and were pretty straight forward to write. Granted, I only did a few simple tests and might switch to pytest at a later time if need be, but for my case unittest worked fine. Tox is configured in the tox.ini file. You can set it up to run your code against any Python version and linters such as flake. When you want to run your tests, you simply navigate to your root and execute tox. Install Package Locally with Editable Installs When I first started, I was using full commands such as python edge.py runtime --setup --start, but then I discovered “Editable Installs”, which will install a package from a local or github source without having to have it on PyPI So, I ran pip install -e . from the root of my project and iotedgedev is now available. This is super helpful because I can just edit my code and when I go back to the command prompt, iotedgedev commands are all up-to-date without any other installs required. Package Distribution: PyPI After you have coded your project, you are going to want to upload it to PyPI test environment to test it out first and then, when ready, upload it to the PyPI production environment. Setuptools, not distutils The Cookiecutter project I used included setuptools configuration. After a quick search, I discovered that’s the preferred route, so I just went with it. Wheel, not egg Wheel and Egg are packaging formats, you can read more about them here. I went with Wheel because it appears to be the recommended approach and it worked the first time I tried it. To generate a new wheel: python setup.py bdist_wheel Bumpversion This package will find all the appropriate versions and bump them up by one when you call it. To bump the version: bumpversion minor Upload Process Push Changes git add .git commit -m \"\"git push Bumpversion and create Wheel bumpversion minor &amp;&amp; python setup.py bdist_wheel Push Tags git push --tags Upload with Twine #testtwine upload -r pypitest dist/azure_iot_edge_dev_tool-0.50.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl#productiontwine upload -r pypi dist/azure_iot_edge_dev_tool-0.52.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl This will read from .pypirc file in the root of your project. Store PyPI Settings in .pypirc Store your PyPI settings in a .pypirc file in the root of your project, which looks something like this: [distutils]index-servers = pypi pypitest[pypi]repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypiusername=yourusernamepassword=[pypitest]repository=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/username=yourusernamepassword= That way when you call twine upload -r pypi ... it will use the repository, username and password in the file instead of typing it every time you push to PyPI. Test Pip Install When you run pip install it will point to production by default, you need to pass --no-cache-dir, --index-url and an --extra-index-url for it to ignore local packages, point to the test env, and use the production env for project dependencies. pip --no-cache-dir install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ iotedgedev --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple Command Line Arguments: Click I started off with argparse and evaluated a few others, but landed on Click because I like how it is integrated into the code. I had everything working with argparse and it was fine, but one I started writing tests I really appreciated that Click came with a CLiRunner object that was really helpful. I converted everything to Click in an hour or so. You can see the final result here: iotedgedev/iotedgedev/cli.py. You can view the full command structure on GitHub here: iotedgedev/README.md Help with -h and --help You can get both -h and --help for help commands if you pass this CONTEXT_SETTINGS = dict(help_option_names=[&quot;-h&quot;, &quot;--help&quot;]) into the @click.group statement. CONTEXT_SETTINGS = dict(help_option_names=['-h', '--help'])@click.group(context_settings=CONTEXT_SETTINGS, invoke_without_command=True) Version Command You can easily get a --version command by adding @click.version_option() above your main method: @click.version_option()def main(): Help Print You can print out the help message using the following code. In my main Package, I want to print help if not commands are passed in and I want there to be an option hanging off the root. This is the only way I could figure out how to do that. def main(set_config): if(set_config): utility.set_config() else: ctx = click.get_current_context() if ctx.invoked_subcommand == None: click.echo(ctx.get_help()) Echo instead of Print Statements Click comes with an echo method that allows you to colorize your print statements and is Python 2/3 safe. One of the last things I did in the project was convert all of my statements to use click.secho. Coloring my output helps differentiate it from the output of the out of proc calls I make. Here, I’m using a mixture of Yellow and White, which looks White and Grey with my current ConEmu color scheme. Out of Process Calls: subprocess.Popen My script makes a bunch of out of process calls to things like dotnet, docker and iotedgectl. I toyed around with a bunch of ways to do this and finally landed on subprocess.Popen because I could get both the status code and the result (print statements) from the call. I wrapped mine in a method like this: def exe_proc(self, params, shell=False): proc = subprocess.Popen( params, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=shell) stdout_data, stderr_data = proc.communicate() if stdout_data != \"\": self.output.procout(self.decode(stdout_data)) if proc.returncode != 0: self.output.error(self.decode(stderr_data)) sys.exit() https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev/blob/master/iotedgedev/utility.py#L24 PyPI Readme PyPI does not natively support Markdown, although the website says it does, after many hours of trying I could not get it to work. They do support RST and there are ways to convert Markdown to RST - but nothing was working for me. The Markdown to RST converter I was using pyandoc was not generating valid RST and I was not interested in maintaining two versions (Markdown &amp; RST) of my Readme. If this project was officially supported by Microsoft, then I would have figured it out, but this is a proof-of-concept project, so I decided to abandon the PyPI readme in favor of GitHub markdown and then linked to GitHub from PyPI. See link to github in this image: Environment Variables: Python-DotEnv My package heavily relies on Environment Variables so I can have a very simple command interface. I did not want to ask the user to type all them in at the command line. I used dotenv in my node projects and was happy to see that there’s one available for Python as well: Python-DotEnv. You can view my .env file here:iotedgedev/template/.env.tmp and you can see how I’m loading it here: iotedgedev/envvars.py This will load the .env from the current directory: from dotenv import load_dotenvdotenv_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '.env')load_dotenv(dotenv_path) And make all the Variables available via os.environ[&quot;NAME&quot;] Make sure you add .env to your .gitignore file. Resources I found this video really helpful: Python Packaging from Init to Deploy Conclusion I still have a lot to learn about Python and package distribution, but I feel like I’m in decent shape after getting this far. I went back and forth from hating Python to sometimes liking it. It took a lot less time to write the Python code then it did to distribute it. I really hope this posts saves you a time.

The docs do a great job explaining every authentication requirement, but do not tell you how to quickly get started. This post will hopefully solve that for you. We’ll first create an Azure Active Directory Service Principal and use it in Postman to generate a Bearer Token and then call the Azure REST APIs. Azure Setup Note that the below configuration uses the default Service Principal configuration values. In a production application you are going to want to configure the Service Principal to be constrained to specific areas of your Azure resources. You can find more about the configuration options here. 1. Install Python 2.7+ The Azure CLI is written in Python, so you’ll need Python to execute any of the CLI commands. 2. Install Azure CLI 2.0 3. Login to CLI az login Go to http://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code show in the console. 4. Set Active Subscription az account set --subscription \"your subscription name or id\" 5. Create Service Principal az ad sp create-for-rbac -n \"your service principal name\" Copy this output to a temp location, you will need the values in a minute. Service Principal Password Reset You can execute the following command if you ever need to reset your Service Principal password. az ad sp reset-credentials --name \"your service principal name\" You can read more about Service Principals here. Postman Setup We are now going to use Postman to execute a REST call to get the Bearer Token and another to Get Resource Groups. 1. Install Postman 2. Close Postman The next step only works if Postman is closed. Please close Postman now. 3. Click “Run in Postman” Click this button: This will open your browser and present you with two options. Select the best option for you under “Open with…” On Windows select “Open with…Postman for Windows” 4. Inspect Requests You will notice that there is a new collection in Postman called “Azure REST”. Take a few minutes to inspect the requests and get familiar with them. Get AAD Token Request This request will POST to https://login.microsoftonline.com//oauth2/token with our Service Principal settings and then, in the “Tests” will set a Postman Global Variable called bearerToken to the access_token in the response. Get Resource Groups Request This request will GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions//resourcegroups?api-version=2017-05-10 with an Authorization header set to the Bearer Token we just requested with ‘Get AAD Token’. 5. Set Environment Variables When you clicked on the “Run in Postman” button Postman also created an Environment for you called “Azure REST”. You will now set your Service Principal settings in the Environment to be used in the requests. Click on the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of Postman and select Manage Environments. Click on the Azure REST Environment and you will see all the required settings. Enter all your settings from the Service Principal we created earlier. Here’s how they map: tenant = tenantIdappId = clientIdpassword = clientSecretsubscriptionId is the same When you are done it will look like this with all the values filled in: Make sure that the Azure REST Environment is selected in the Environment dropdown in the upper right hand corner of Postman. We are now ready to execute the requests! 4. Execute Get AAD Token Request First, we will execute the Get AAD Token request to get our Bearer Token and put it in a Postman global variable. Open the Get AAD Token request and click the Send button. You will see the following output: &#123; \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"expires_in\": \"3599\", \"ext_expires_in\": \"0\", \"expires_on\": \"1512031433\", \"not_before\": \"1512027533\", \"resource\": \"https://management.azure.com/\", \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV...tS-OmwIfRw\"&#125; The access_token property is now stored a global variable, which was set in the “Tests” tab. pm.globals.set(\"bearerToken\", pm.response.json().access_token); 5. Execute Get Resource Groups Request We’ll now execute any Azure REST API with that Bearer Token. Just as an exercise, we’ll execute the Get Resource Groups request. Open the Get Resource Groups request and click the Send button. You will see the following output: &#123; \"value\": [ &#123; \"id\": \"/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/cloud-shell-storage-westus\", \"name\": \"cloud-shell-storage-westus\", \"location\": \"westus\", \"properties\": &#123; \"provisioningState\": \"Succeeded\" &#125; &#125; ]&#125; That’s all there is to it. Now you can go an explore all of the Azure REST APIs and use this same method to generate the required Bearer Token Authorization header. Please let me know if you run in to any issues.

While this will be officially supported eventually, right now it is not, but there is a workaround. It isn’t officially supported out of the box because the runtime deploys the “edgeHub” container under-the-covers from Docker Hub and there’s no obvious way to override that. I’ve been working with the Azure IoT team over the last couple of days to unblock a customer who has network restrictions that prevent them from running the Edge from anything other than the West Europe Azure Region. Here’s everything that we had to do to get it running. Hopefully this helps you out while the Azure team gets this officially implemented. Azure IoT Edge Configuration The first thing you are going to want to do is go to the azure-iot-edge-config repository and learn about the two types of Edge configuration: Runtime and Module configuration. Come back to this post after you have absorbed that info. Setup Azure Resources 1. Create IoT Hub &amp; Edge Device 2. Create Azure Container Registry Azure Container Registry Setup You are first going to pull the Azure IoT Edge containers down to your local machine, tag them and then push them to your own ACR. Pull Containers Open a command prompt and execute the following statements to pull the Azure IoT Edge runtime modules down to your machine. docker pull microsoft/azureiotedge-agent:1.0-previewdocker pull microsoft/azureiotedge-hub:1.0-previewdocker pull microsoft/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0-preview Tag Containers Tag each of the images with ACR URI: Replace 'myregistry` with the name of your registry docker tag microsoft/azureiotedge-agent:1.0-preview myregistry.azurecr.io/azureiotedge-agent:1.0-previewdocker tag microsoft/azureiotedge-hub:1.0-preview myregistry.azurecr.io/azureiotedge-hub:1.0-previewdocker tag microsoft/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0-preview myregistry.azurecr.io/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0-preview Push Containers You will now push your newly tagged images to your ACR. But first you need to login to your ACR. docker login myregistry.azurecr.io -u xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx -p password You can get the ACR credentials from the Azure Portal, under Access Keys Now push those images to your ACR. docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/azureiotedge-agent:1.0-previewdocker push myregistry.azurecr.io/azureiotedge-hub:1.0-previewdocker push myregistry.azurecr.io/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0-preview You will now see your images under the ‘Repositories’ section of your ACR. Modify Config You now need to change two config files: Runtime and Module Configuration. Runtime Configuration When you run iotedgectl setup you can pass it a custom config file, which will contain your ACR credentials. See azure-iot-edge-config for more information about IoT Edge configuration requirements. Here’s how to get your config file setup: 1. Copy this file (runtimeconfig.json) to your local machine. 2. Open file and replace all the tokens [[enter …]] with your values for your ACR URI, password, username, connection string and hostname. 3. Save the file. Now when you setup the Edge Runtime you pass it a --config-file parameter to your new config file. iotedgectl setup --config-file config.json Then run start, and you’ll see it pull from your ACR instead of Docker Hub iotedgectl start View the docker logs and you should see this message, which is normal. It says it is waiting for a module config, which we will do next. docker logs edgeAgent -f 2017-11-23 04:26:57 [ERR] - Error refreshing edge agent configuration from twin.Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.Core.ConfigSources.ConfigEmptyException: This device has an empty configuration for the edge agent. Please set a deployment manifest. at Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.IoTHub.EdgeAgentConnection.UpdateDeploymentConfig() in /opt/vsts/work/1/s/edge-agent/src/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.IoTHub/EdgeAgentConnection.cs:line 138 at Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.IoTHub.EdgeAgentConnection.&lt;RefreshTwinAsync&gt;d__14.MoveNext() in /opt/vsts/work/1/s/edge-agent/src/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.IoTHub/EdgeAgentConnection.cs:line 912017-11-23 04:26:58 [INF] - Updated reported properties Module Configuration Now we need to apply a custom configuration to the module twin config in the cloud. See azure-iot-edge-config for more information about IoT Edge configuration requirements. 0. Install Python 2.7+ 1. Copy this file (moduleconfig.json) to your local machine. 2. Change all of the [[enter ACR URI]] tags with your ACR URI. 3. Save the file 4. Clone this repo azure-iot-rest git clone https://github.com/jongio/azure-iot-rest.git 5. Open command and navigate to data-plane\\devices and execute the following to apply your new configuration file: python device-conf.py --name [iothubname] --key [iothubkey] --device-id [deviceid] --config-file [path to module config] You will see this output: If you go back to your docker logs: docker logs edgeAgent -f You will now see the runtime pull that new module configuration file and run all the appropriate containers from your ACR. And you can verify that the events are being received by using Device Explorer or the CLI monitor-events method described on this post. That should do it! Trust me, this experience will get better, but for now this is what we have to deal with. Please comment or reach out if you have any issues.

Here’s how to get it running on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Stretch or Stretch Lite. Raspbian Jessie should work as well, but I haven’t tested it yet. Azure IoT Edge does not run on Raspberry Pi with Windows 10 IoT Core, you must use an x64 based board such as the MinnowBoard. Windows 10 IoT Core Instructions can be found here. Raspberry Pi Setup 1. Setup Raspberry Pi - Follow these instructions to get your Raspberry Pi setup for general Pi dev. Make sure you change the Pi’s hostname so you don’t have a network naming conflict. 2. Install Python &amp;&amp; pip - The Azure IoT Edge Runtime is a Python pip, so Python and pip are required on your edge device. Raspbian comes with Python 2.7, but run the following to make sure you have it installed. python --version It should output Python 2.7.13. Python 3 will also work. Raspbian Full also comes with pip 9.0.1, but run the following to make sure you have it installed. Raspbian Lite does not come with pip, so skip to the install command below to install it. pip --version It should output pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7). If you do not have either of those, then you can install with the following command: sudo apt install python-pip -y 3. Upgrade Setup Tools You will find the Azure IoT Edge Runtime on PyPI here, which has the Raspbian specific steps, which I’ve included here as well. I’ve asked the team to include these steps in the Linux setup tutorial guide. This issue is being tracked on GitHub here. Open a Terminal and run the following: sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools pipsudo apt install python2.7-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev -y 3. Install Docker - The Azure IoT Edge Runtime runs as a container and each module is a container, so Docker is required. Azure IoT and Azure IoT Edge Setup Now that you have your Raspberry Pi all setup, you can now follow the instructions on the official Azure IoT Edge docs site: Deploy Azure IoT Edge on a simulated device in Linux When you’re all set up and running, you can use ConEmu to see all the logs flowing through in a nice paned layout. Troubleshooting 1. Upgrade Setup Tools If you see any of the following errors, then please run the Upgrade Setup Tools step above.

I’ve been using TrackR for a couple of months now without issue. But I am surprised that the initial battery only lasted 2 months. TrackR states that it should last a year, but have seen 3-4 months usage out of them. The one in my wallet has not died yet and I got them both at the same time. Original Post I just made the switch from Tile to Trackr. I bought two Tiles around this time last year, one for my keys and one for my wallet. The Tile worked well for a while, but then it didn’t, and then the battery died, so I was on the hunt for a different option. I did a bunch of research and finally landed on the Trackr because it was the second highest rated tracker after the Tile and it has a replaceable battery. The two big reasons I made the switch was because the Tile didn’t always work and the battery isn’t replaceable. Tile dosn’t always work It seems that everytime I wanted to find my stuff, the Tile couldn’t find it. It would say it is nearby, but couldn’t connect to it. Or it would tell me it couldn’t find it even though I was holding both my phone and my wallet. When I contacted support, then sent me a slew of questions, but never resolved my issue. When was the last time your Tile played a tune when you pressed “Find” in the app? In the app, were you able to press “Find”? Did the green “Find” button change to a blue “Done” button? Does your Tile play a tune when you press the silver or “tile” button firmly for one second? Does your Tile ring your phone when you double-press firmly on the silver or “tile” button on your Tile? Ultimately, I never got around to figuring out why it didn’t work…then… Tile’s battery isn’t replaceable After about 9 months, I got a message from Tile saying that both of my Tiles needed to be replaced. Apparently, the battery only lasts one year and then it shuts off. I didn’t realize this when I bought them. I thought it would last at least a few years. The Tile Slim for my wallet is $30 The Tile Mate for my keys is $25 That’s $55 a year to track my stuff. It’s not that expensive, but I’m considering getting a few more for my family. I don’t want to have to spend $100 a year. I’d rather buy the device once and swap the batteries out when needed. The Trackr, on the other hand, is $25 ($14 after coupon) and the battery (CR2016) can be found for a couple bucks each on Amazon. Trackr Coupons If you do decide to purchase a Trackr, make sure you google ‘trackr coupons’ first. I was able to get $10 off each of the two I ordered directly from their website.

So, when you create your Queue, make sure you DO NOT check the boxes below: “Enable duplicate detection” “Enable sessions” Jon","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Azure","slug":"Tech/Azure","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Azure/"}],"tags":[{"name":"azure","slug":"azure","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/azure/"},{"name":"iot","slug":"iot","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/iot/"}]},{"title":"How to use Apache Avro Compression with Azure IoT, Azure Stream Analytics, and Node.js","slug":"azure-iot-stream-analytics-avro-nodejs","date":"2017-05-03T21:32:50.000Z","updated":"2018-12-11T02:49:05.075Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/05/azure-iot-stream-analytics-avro-nodejs/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2017/05/azure-iot-stream-analytics-avro-nodejs/","excerpt":"","text":"I was recently working with a customer that uses Apache Avro compression and discovered that there isn’t a great example out there that shows you how to send Avro compressed messages through the IoT pipeline. This post will hopefully fill that gap. Compression is a very common need in IoT scenarios because most large scale IoT solutions include message aggregation and compression before sending the messages across the wire. IoT Hub itself “supports compression” because it doesn’t crack the message payload - it just treats the message as bytes across the wire. So, the cloud endpoint (IoT Hub) isn’t an issue. The issue arises when we need to use compression and then process those messages post-ingestion. Azure Stream Analytics, a common Azure IoT message ingestor, supports JSON, CSV and Avro. Gzip/Deflate are not supported, but the request has been made into the ASA team to support them. In the meantime, this post will demonstrate how to get Avro to work through the IoT pipeline and unblock those customers that want compression and are considering Avro. If you need to support Gzip/Deflate or any other compression mechanism, then you will need to process your IoT Hub messages via the backing Event Hub using Event Processor Host via Azure Functions, Service Fabric or any custom application. The architecture for this walkthrough is as follows: A Node.js script reads telemetry data from sensors, compresses that data with Avro and then sends to IoT Hub. An Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) job picks up those messages and forwards them to Azure Blob Storage as JSON objects. You can follow along to build this entire example from scratch or you can click here, if you just want to jump to the Avro code. Tools Azure CLI 2.0 You have three options for creating the Azure resources required for this example. I will use Azure CLI 2.0 in this post. 1. Azure CLI 2.0 2. Azure CLI 1.0 3. Azure Portal Follow the steps here to install Azure CLI 2.0. iothub-explorer We will use the iothub-explorer to monitor messages that are sent to IoT Hub. Follow the steps here to install the iothub-explorer. You could also use the Windows Form version called the Device Explorer. Azure Storage Explorer We will use Azure Storage Explorer to view the outputted messages that are sent to Blob storage from the ASA job. Follow the steps here to install the Azure Storage Explorer. IoT Hub Create IoT Hub Follow the steps here to create an Azure IoT Hub using the Azure CLI 2.0. Get IoT Hub Connection String Execute the following command to get the connection string for the IoT Hub you just created. az iot hub show-connection-string --hub-name [your IoT Hub name] Copy that connection string to a safe place. You will need it later. Create IoT Hub Device Execute the following command to create a new IoT Hub device. az iot device create --hub-name [your IoT Hub name] --device-id [your IoT Hub device name] Get Device Connection String az iot device show-connection-string --hub-name [your IoT Hub name] --device-id [your IoT Hub device name] Copy that device’s connection string to a safe place. You will need it later. Create IoT Hub Consumer Group You will need a new IoT Hub consumer group when you configure ASA later. Let’s create it now with the following command: az iot hub consumer-group create --hub-name [your IoT Hub name] --name avrocg Start Monitoring Events Execute the following command to monitor events for the device you just created: iothub-explorer monitor-events [your IoT Hub device name] --login \"[your IoT Hub connection string goes here]\" You will see the following output: Monitoring events from device avro-device... Keep that command open, we’ll come back to it in a minute. Run Avro Script We will now get the Node.js code that will compress messages with Avro and send them to IoT Hub. Let’s get it running and then go through code. Install Node.js and git Make sure you have Node.js and git installed. Clone Repo Open up a command prompt, navigate to an empty folder and execute the following command. This will copy the code to a local folder. git clone https://github.com/jongio/azure-iot-stream-analytics-avro-nodejs.git Install Node.js Packages Change to the directory that contains the code you just cloned and execute the following command to get the Node.js packages locally. npm i Setup Config This script uses dotenv to allow you to set an IoT Hub connection string in a .env file. Rename “.env.sample” to “.env” and paste your device connection string that you saved earlier. If you are using Windows, then name the file .env. (with the . at the end) and Windows will automatically change it to .env for you. iotHubConnectionString=[your device's connection string goes here] Run Script Execute the following to start sending messages to IoT Hub. node index.js You will now see the following output: Connected to IoT HubSending message: Obj╔╝avro.schema�╔&#123;\"name\":\"telemetry\",\"type\":\"record\",\"fields\":[&#123;\"name\":\"deviceId\",\"type\":\"string\"&#125;,&#123;\"name\":\"windSpeed\",\"type\":\"float\"&#125;]&#125;avro.codecdeflate &#125;4똑�%�� ��E��x╗�KI-�LN5��&#125;4똑�%�� ��E��xsend status: MessageEnqueuedSending message: Obj╔╝avro.schema�╔&#123;\"name\":\"telemetry\",\"type\":\"record\",\"fields\":[&#123;\"name\":\"deviceId\",\"type\":\"string\"&#125;,&#123;\"name\":\"windSpeed\",\"type\":\"float\"&#125;]&#125;avro.codecdeflate �7�zXNObQU&#125;��╗�KI-�LN5�=��7�zXNObQU&#125;��send status: MessageEnqueuedSending message: Obj╔╝avro.schema�╔&#123;\"name\":\"telemetry\",\"type\":\"record\",\"fields\":[&#123;\"name\":\"deviceId\",\"type\":\"string\"&#125;,&#123;\"name\":\"windSpeed\",\"type\":\"float\"&#125;]&#125;avro.codecdeflate ��b�zj����[���╗�KI-�LN5 �p╝ ��b�zj����[���send status: MessageEnqueued Monitor Messages Coming into IoT Hub Switch back to the command prompt with iothub-explorer open and you will now start to see events outputted: ==== From: avro ====Obj\u0001\u0004\u0016avro.schema�\u0001&#123;\"name\":\"telemetry\",\"type\":\"record\",\"fields\":[&#123;\"name\":\"deviceId\",\"type\":\"string\"&#125;,&#123;\"name\":\"windSpeed\",\"type\":\"float\"&#125;]&#125;\u0014avro.codec\u000edeflate K=�8h &#123;�!���ng�q\u0002\u001c�KI-�LN5��1r\u0004 K=�8h &#123;�!���ng�q======================== From: avro ====Obj\u0001\u0004\u0016avro.schema�\u0001&#123;\"name\":\"telemetry\",\"type\":\"record\",\"fields\":[&#123;\"name\":\"deviceId\",\"type\":\"string\"&#125;,&#123;\"name\":\"windSpeed\",\"type\":\"float\"&#125;]&#125;\u0014avro.codec\u000edeflate ӣ ��މ�]#��T��\u0002\u001c�KI-�LN5\\���\u0011 ӣ ��މ�]#��T��==================== Inspect Avro Script Now that we have it running, let’s take a look at the script to see how it works. You can see the full code on GitHub here. There are lots of comments inline that should help you see how it all works together. The script uses following npm packages: avsc, memory-streams, azure-iot-device and azure-iot-device-amqp. With Avro, you can embed the payload schema into the Avro Container file. In this repo, we have a file called schema.avsc, which looks like this: &#123; \"name\": \"telemetry\", \"type\": \"record\", \"fields\": [ &#123; \"name\": \"deviceId\", \"type\": \"string\" &#125;, &#123; \"name\": \"windSpeed\", \"type\": \"float\" &#125; ]&#125; In fact, ASA requires the schema to be embedded into the message payload. This file Avro type is loaded via the parse method like this: const type = avro.parse(__dirname + '/schema.avsc'); At the moment, ASA does not support ENUMs in your Avro schema. Convert the ENUM to string if you are having issues. I will update this post when that has been resolved. The meat of the code is as follows: Instantiate a BlockEncoder with deflate codec Instantiate a WriteableStream and pipe BlockEncoder writes to it. Write to the BlockEncoder Call BlockEncoder.end(); Send IoT Hub message in the ‘end’ event handler, which calls WriateableStream.toBuffer() // Instantiate a BlockEncoder, which allows you to write avro into a buffer.var avroEncoder = new avro.streams.BlockEncoder(type, &#123; codec: 'deflate' &#125;); // Choose 'deflate' or it will default to 'null'// Instantiate a stream to write the avro buffer to, which we'll send to IoT Hubvar writer = new streams.WritableStream();avroEncoder.pipe(writer);// Generate the faux jsonvar windSpeed = 10 + (Math.random() * 4); // range: [10, 14]var json = &#123; deviceId: 'device1', windSpeed: windSpeed &#125;;// Write the jsonif (type.isValid(json)) &#123; avroEncoder.write(json);&#125;// Call end to tell avro we are done writing and to trigger the end event.avroEncoder.end();// end event was triggered, get the avro data from the piped stream and send to IoT Hub.avroEncoder.on('end', function () &#123; // call toBuffer on the WriteableStream and pass to IoT Hub message ctor var message = new Message(writer.toBuffer()); console.log('Sending message: ' + message.getData()); client.sendEvent(message, printResultFor('send'));&#125;) While this seems like a pretty straight forward script, it took me a while to get it all working. In the process, I collected the following Avro related resources: Avro Node.js Library: mtth/avsc Reading and Writing Avro Files From the Command Line Node.js Stream Docs Creating duplex streams with Node.js How to send compacted data to Azure Stream Analytics? Sending and consuming events in Avro format Rotate stream into google cloud storage #75 BlockEncoder produces invalid avro format? #17 avro-cli-examples Azure Blob Storage For this contrived exercise, we’re going to configure a Blob Storage account that ASA sends all messages to. Let’s create the account and then wire up ASA. Create Azure Blob Storage az storage account create --sku Standard_LRS --resource-group [your resource group] --location eastus --name [enter storage name here] You will see the storage account meta data outputted to the screen. Azure Stream Analytics Create Azure Stream Analytics Job Go to the Azure Portal and create a new Azure Steam Analytics job: Wire Up IoT Hub Input 1. Go to the ASA job you just created and click on Inputs. Something to be aware of, ASA does not allow you to test the input with a physical Avro container file, like it does with JSON/CSV. The only way to test Avro is to send the message to the ASA Input and view the logs if you have issues. The logs are not that helpful as all it says is the file is invalid. 2. Click Add and create a new Input There are two bugs in the Azure Portal on this screen: You can’t select Avro using your mouse. You must use your keyboard arrows in the “Event Serialization Format” dropdown. You can’t use $Default consumer group. Use the consumer group you created earlier, I called mine avrocg. Wire Up Blob Storage Output 3. Click on Outputs, click Add and create a new Input Select the Blob Storage Account you created earlier Select Create a new container and name it avros. Write ASA Query 4. Click on Query, then enter the following query into the query text box. SELECT *INTO avrooutputFROM avroinput This query is intentionally simple because this post is about wiring everything up and not sophisticated ASA queries. 5. Click Save Start ASA Job Click ‘Overview’, then click Start Once the ASA job is started, you will see the following monitoring visual in the Azure Portal. If you have any issues, please refer to the Activity log tab to see if any messages are being logged. View Blob Storage Messages We’ll now use the Azure Storage Explorer to inspect the JSON messages that have been stored in Blob Storage. 1. Open Azure Storage Explorer, sign-in and navigate to the Blob Storage account you created earlier. Expand the Blob Containers node. Click on ‘avros’ and you will see a JSON file in the right pane. 2. Double-click on that file to download it. Open it and you will see the JSON messages. &#123; \"deviceId\": \"device1\", \"windSpeed\": 11.22899055480957, \"EventProcessedUtcTime\": \"2017-05-05T05:52:52.0236378Z\", \"PartitionId\": 0, \"EventEnqueuedUtcTime\": \"2017-05-05T05:51:52.7660000Z\", \"IoTHub\": &#123; \"MessageId\": null, \"CorrelationId\": null, \"ConnectionDeviceId\": \"avro-device\", \"ConnectionDeviceGenerationId\": \"636295329478829335\", \"EnqueuedTime\": \"2017-05-05T05:51:53.2330000Z\", \"StreamId\": null &#125;&#125; Conclusion We now have all of the services setup and running that enable Avro compression in an Azure IoT solution. 1.

Postman is more than just an ad-hoc REST tester - I believe that the future of REST API documentation will be delivered via Postman. Swagger is a great starting point for API documentation, but it doesn’t give you the full power that Postman does via the “pre-request script” blocks and “tests”. Postman compliments Swagger by adding accompanying code to assist in the execution of your documentions. I like to call this experiment “Executable Documentation”, because in the end, I want to send my users a Postman link that allows them to execute the docs without having to comb through docs and samples. Every uri, body format, header is right there in plain sight in a single location. Super powerful. If you’ve been following along with my previous Postman posts, or have your Postman Collection exactly the way you want it, you are going to want to run it on a regular basis to ensure it is fully working for your customers at all times. You can use any continuous integration suite to do so. If you want to use Jenkins, you can host Jenkins on Azure and then follow this post to get it configured. Another great CI option is Microsoft’s Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) “Build &amp; Release” service. This post will show you how to setup a VSTS code project and build definition to run your Postman Collections with newman on a regular basis. newman is a server side Postman collection executor. Setup VSTS Code Project This is where we will store our Postman collection definition and environment variables file (needed when you run newman) and run our builds. 1. Go to http://visualstudio.com and create a new account if you don’t have one. Everything we do here today should be free (let me know if that is not the case). 2. Create a new account and project. In my case, my account name is ‘azurerest’ and my project name is ‘iot’ 3. Clone the repo. Click ‘Code’ tab, click the project, and then click the Clone link in the upper right to find the clone URI. git clone [your vsts project clone uri] Export Postman Collection and Environment Variables You will commit your Postman collection definition file and environment variables to VSTS. You will be committing secrets to source control, but in this case I could not find a good workaround for this because Postman expects a local file for Environment variables. You can control permissions to this repo if you are concerned with the secrets getting exposed - or maybe get Azure Key Vault or Blob Storage into your build process. Save the following files to the VSTS repo you created earlier. 1. Export Postman Collection by selecting the “…” button on the collection details page and selecting “Export” 2. Export Envrionment Variables by clicking the gear icon, select Manage Environments and then click the Download Environment icon. Your local repo should now look like this, with both the Postman Collection and the Envrionment Variables file Push File to VSTS Project You now need to push the Postman Collection and Environment Variables file to VSTS, so the build process can pick them up. Execute the following from the repo root: git add .git commit -m \"Init commit\"git push You can verify that your files have been pushed to the repo via visualstudio.com Create VSTS Build Definition Now we will create the VSTS build definition to execute the collection on a regular basis. 1. Click Build &amp; Release, then click “+ New Definition” 2. Click “empty process” in the middle of the left pane 3. Click “Add Task” and then click the Add button for “npm” 4. Select “npm install” in the build task list and enter “newman -g” into the “arguments” textbox. 5. Click “Add Task” and then click the Add button for “Command Line” 6. Select “Run newman” in the built task list and enter the following into the “arguments” textbox. run $(Build.SourcesDirectory)\\iot.json -e $(Build.SourcesDirectory)\\env.json The first argument is the Postman Collection file and the second argument (-e) is the Environment Variables file. 7. Click the “Save &amp; queue” button to save this build definition. 8. Select the “Hosted” Agent queue and then click the “Queue” button. You can see the execution details by drilling into the build: And here’s what success looks like. Build Schedule You can now schedule this build via the Build -&gt; Triggers form and also integrate it into your CI process Example Failure Test Case As a test, I created a sample that intentionally fails, so you can see that the Postman test cases will also fail the VSTS tests The request returns a 500 and the test is looking for a 200. Postman Test Code var responseJSON;try &#123; responseJSON = JSON.parse(responseBody); tests[\"Status equals 200\"] = responseJSON.status === 200;&#125;catch (e) &#123; &#125;tests[\"Body contains status\"] = responseBody.has(\"status\"); Conclusion So that’s it. You now have a source controlled Postman collection that is part of your CI process and setup to run on a schedule to suit your needs. My next post will wrap up everything I’ve learned with Postman and my pitch for using it as an “Executable Documentation” engine.

The following is based on: Azure Friday: Host Jenkins on Azure - with some added modifications to make sure you are SSH tunneling into the Jenkins app instead of accessing over an insecure channel. Here are the steps we’ll follow: 1. Deploy Azure Jenkins Template, which will provision Jenkins on a VM for you. 2. Get Jenkins VM IP Address 3. Open Port 8080 on the Azure Network Security Group 4. SSH to VM (with either Putty or bash) 5. Get Temp Admin Password 6. Launch Jenkins Admin App 7. Setup Jenkins 8. Create Admin User 9. Restart Jenkins 10. Login 11. Happy Dance Deploy Azure Jenkins Template 1. Go to http://aka.ms/azjenkins 2. Click ‘Deploy to Azure’ 3. Complete the form, click ‘Purchase’ and wait for it to provision the Linux VM. Get Jenkins VM IP Address 1. Get the Jenkins VM IP Address from the Overview blade, you will need this later. Open Port 8080 The Jenkins Admin app is on port 8080, but, at the time of this writing, port 8080 is not open in the Network Security Group created by the Azure Deployment template. 1. In the Azure Portal, find the Network Security Group that was just created. 2. If you don’t see 8080 there, then click Inbound Security Rules, then click Add 3. Give it a name and set Port range to 8080 Connect to VM We are going to connect to the VM via SSH to: 1. Get the temp Jenkins Admin password 2. Launch the Jenkins Admin app You can use an SSH client such as Putty or bash. Since the VM does not have an SSL cert, you should create a secure tunnel to port 8080 and access via 127.0.0.1 instead of going to the website over the unencrypted internet. Connect via Putty 1. Download and Open Putty Option 1: Putty Command Line You can connect via command line using the following command. This will open the secure channel as well. putty.exe -ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 jongadmin@40.83.216.117 Option 2: Putty UI 1. Enter the Jenkins VM Public IP, enter a name ‘jenkinsvm’ and then click Save. 2. In the left nav, click Connection -&gt; SSH -&gt; Tunnels 3. Set the following values: Source port: 8080 Destination: 127.0.0.1:8080 4. Click “Add” button and you will see L8080 127.0.0.1:8080 in the textarea. 5. Go back to the “Session” tab and click “Save” button to save the port forward that you just entered. 6. Click Open and click Yes if you see the following dialog: 7.

Like many people, I used to think Starbucks was good coffee. That was until I experienced freshly roasted and freshly ground coffee. That was 3 years ago, and since then I went deep into learning everything there is to know about great coffee. With that, I do a lot of tweeting about my experience with my E61 brew group and my office coffee setup. It’s a simple pour over, but with high quality coffee (usually Victrola these days) and godly aromas, I often get the attention of my office neighbors who are drawn in by the smells. I believe that coffee is more than a drink, it is an experience. It is something to be savored and lingered on. I enjoy watching the coffee pour out of my bottomless portafilter just as much as drinking the coffee. The perfect color - the perfect tiger striping and perfect volume. I get excited just thinking about it. I’ve written about my passion for all things before and coffee keeps bubbling up as the number one thing I could do for the rest of my life. All this passion got the attention of Howard Schultz - who many of you know is stepping down as CEO of Starbucks to pursue his passion of getting high quality coffee into Starbucks. Through many discussions and trips all over the coffee producing world - Guatemala was amazing - I’ve decided to accept a position as the Chief Coffee Officer for Howard’s new passion. I’ll start by going into an intensive coffee production training program all around South America and then will officially start at Howard’s new secret location in Seattle. I hope to see you at the Starbucks Roastery in Seattle. Here are Starbucks we always want to hear what you have to say about the quality of our coffee. When giving us that feedback, please try to look beyond the mass production we’ve done over the years and focus on the single-origin, small batch, freshly roasted beans that will be in select locations.

You can read about that experience here: How to Use the Azure IoT Hub Device Twins REST APIs with Postman and Newman. Since then, I’ve really been turned on to the idea that Postman and Newman are excellent tools for communicating proper REST API usage to customers and not just a REST execution utility. Not only does it show you everything you need to execute the calls, it actually provides you with a mechanism to execute them from within Postman App or on the server via Newman. You, as an API creator, want to limit the amount of friction your customers have to go through to use your APIs. Especially with APIs that require authentication or SAS/SigV4 token generation code, like Azure and AWS do. I think there is great value in being able to point your customers to a Postman Collection URL that allows them to quickly execute all of your APIs and start using them with very little ramp up. Click the following “Run with Postman” image if you want to skip right to the Azure IoT REST APIs Postman Collection (function (p,o,s,t,m,a,n) { !p[s] && (p[s] = function () { (p[t] || (p[t] = [])).push(arguments); }); !o.getElementById(s+t) && o.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(( (n = o.createElement(\"script\")), (n.id = s+t), (n.async = 1), (n.src = m), n )); }(window, document, \"_pm\", \"PostmanRunObject\", \"https://run.pstmn.io/button.js\")); From my experience with Azure IoT Device Twin REST APIs, I thought it would be great to do the same thing for the entire Azure IoT REST API surface. I’m a huge fan of starting small and showing incremental progress, so with this post, I’m going to show you how I got the entire Azure IoT Resource Provider REST API surface working in Postman and Newman. The Resource Provider REST APIs allow you to manage IoT Hubs as an Azure Resource via the Azure Resource Manager APIs. The official Swagger for the Resource Provider APIs can be found here: Azure IoT Hub Resource Provider Swagger. I’ve written this blog post with two audiences in mind: 1. View Only: You want to learn how to use the Azure IoT Resource Provider REST APIs but don’t want to setup all the Azure resources required to execute the requests. See Option 1: View Requests Only below. 2. View and Execute: You want to learn how to use the APIs and execute them against your Azure Subscription. See Option 2: View and Execute Requests below. Install Postman With either approach below, you will need to install Postman, which you can do here: Install Postman. I use the Desktop version, but the Chrome version should work fine as well. Option 1: View Requests Only If all you want to do is view the requests in Postman without executing anything, then jump to the Open Postman Collection section below. Option 2: View and Execute Requests If you want to view the requests and execute them against your Azure Subscription, then you will need to do the following. Set Postman Environment Variables Postman allows you to setup variables and allows you to group them by “Environment”. For this exercise, you will create a new Environment and add the required variables. 1. In Postman, click the Manage Environments option under the gears icon in the upper right. 2. Click Add, then Click Bulk Edit 3. Paste the following into the textbox: 4. Give it a name like “Azure IoT Hub” 5. We will now work on creating Azure resources and getting all of the variables needed to execute the Postman collection. Setup Azure Resources 1. Create Azure Subscription You will likely already have an Azure Subscription, but if you don’t, you can create one in the Azure Portal. Whether you just created an Azure Subscription or are using an existing one, you will need your Subscription Id to execute these REST API calls. Copy your Subscription Id, which is a GUID, to the subscriptionId Postman Environment variable. 2. Create Azure Active Directory (AAD) App You will need an AAD app to call any of the Resource Provider REST APIs. Please follow this blog post to create your AAD app: How to Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) Access Tokens in Postman. When you come back to this post, you will have the following variables. clientId clientSecret tenantId Copy these variables into the corresponding Postman Environment variables. If you do not have those 3 things, then please go back to the above blog post to get them. 3. Create Azure Blob Storage Account You will need an Azure Blob Storage Account to use the Device Bulk Export, Import, Update and Delete REST APIs. You can skip this step if you don’t need to test Device Bulk operations, but just keep in mind that those requests will fail. 1. Create the Blob Storage Account, feel free to use Azure Storage Explorer to do so. 2. Create two containers, one called ‘export’ and one called ‘import’. This is what your Blob Account will look like when you are done with this step: Find your account name and key: When you are done with this step, you will have the following: deviceStorageAccountName deviceStorageAccountKey Copy these variables into the corresponding Postman Environment variables. 4. Create IoT Hub You will likely already have an IoT Hub, but in case you don’t please go to the Azure Portal and create one. When you are done with this step, you will have the following variables. resourceGroupName - the name of the Resource Group that your IoT Hub belongs to resourceName - the name of your IoT Hub resourceKey - the Primary key for iotowner policy Copy these variables into the corresponding Postman Environment variables. Choose an IoT Hub name to create and delete. The only other remaining required variable is “iotHubCreateDeleteName”. I made this a seperate variable so people don’t inadvertently delete an IoT Hub. You can set this variable to whatever you want, but it has to be unique. Open Postman Collection Postman provides the ability for you to share a Postman collection via URL and a “Run in Postman” button that you can embed in your documentation. If you’d like to open the entire Azure IoT Postman collection, then click on the “Run in Postman” button below. It will open Postman, where you can execute each request or just have a look around. (function (p,o,s,t,m,a,n) { !p[s] && (p[s] = function () { (p[t] || (p[t] = [])).push(arguments); }); !o.getElementById(s+t) && o.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(( (n = o.createElement(\"script\")), (n.id = s+t), (n.async = 1), (n.src = m), n )); }(window, document, \"_pm\", \"PostmanRunObject\", \"https://run.pstmn.io/button.js\")); When you open the collection you will see the following: Feel free to poke around and drill into whatever API you’d like to or execute them if you have done the setup steps above. Run Postman Collection 1. Select the Environment that you create earlier, you may have called it Azure IoT Hub 2. Click the ‘Run’ Button This will load the Postman Collection Runner window. 3. Click ‘Start Test’ You will immediately start to see the request results With the current configuration, the tests will take a while to execute because I am running the “Create IoT Hub” request and the “Verify IoT Hub” request, which is a polling request that returns a “Success” code when the IoT Hub is created. Run Postman Collection via Newman Newman is a Postman Collection runner CLI. With Newman, you can run Postman collections as part of your continuous integration suite. For example, the following will execute a Postman Collection with a given set of Environment variables. newman run postman-collection.json -e environment-variables.json Here’s how to run the Azure IoT Hub collection with Newman. 0. Install Newman npm i -g newman 1. Export the Postman Collection 2. Export the Environment Variables Click the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of Postman and select Manage Environments and then click the Download Environment button. 3. Open a CMD and execute the following command: newman run \"Azure IoT Hub.postman_collection.json\" -e \"Azure IoT Hub.postman_environment.json\" You will see the following when the run completes There’s a chance you will get errors when running these, especially the Export/Import Device requests. I’m following up with the Azure IoT team on this. If you do run into this issue, just run again or try again after some time. Setup Postman Monitor I haven’t tried this yet, but Postman offers a PRO feature called “Monitor”, which allows you to schedule the Collection Run. I am more interested in integration with existing continuous integration software, which I will be exploring very soon. In the meantime, checkout their post Integrating automated API tests with Jenkins.

If you don’t already know, Postman is an app that allows you to easily test REST APIs. I’m in the process of attempting to demonstrate that Postman is an amazing tool to not only test APIs, but all be a primary usage communication mechanism for REST APIs. What I think is missing from most documentation is thorough examples of exactly how to use an API…including generating all the complex authentication tokens needed to execute those APIs. Postman can fill that gap - but getting SAS tokens for Postman requests is not as straight forward as it can be. Click here to jump right to the GitHub repo azure-sas-tokens-postman that contains all you need to get started with Azure Storage SAS Tokens in Postman. I want a development team to be able to point a user of their REST API to a Postman collection file which fully describes how to use the API, with executable code samples - and SAS token generation code. I also want them to be able to do that without any dependencies on any other services. To prove this out, I’m starting with the Azure IoT Resource Provider REST APIs. The docs can be found here: Azure IoT Resource Provider REST API Docs and the Swagger file is here: Azure IoT Resource Provider Swagger I’m still working on fleshing everything out for that API and I will post the full example soon, but I wanted to pause and blog about how I was able to get the Azure Storage SAS Token that is used in the Azure IoT Export Devices REST API. That is an API that allows you to export your Azure IoT device metadata to a blob in an Azure Storage account. In order to do so, you have to pass the full Azure Storage Blob URI with a SAS Token QueryString in the body of the device export request. You can find the docs for it here: Azure IoT Hub Export Devices API. The API is straight-forward: 1. HTTP POST JSON payload to /exportDevices 2. API creates a job that exports Azure IoT Device Metadata to an Azure Storage blob. The format of the REST API is as follows: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/resourceGroups/:resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/:resourceName/exportDevices?api-version=&#123;&#123;api-version&#125;&#125; The format of the JSON payload is as follows: &#123; \"exportBlobContainerUri\": \"https://azurestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container?azureStorageSasTokenQueryString\", \"excludeKeys\": \"false\"&#125; As you can see from the Export Devices API docs that JSON format is not actually documented and it doesn’t tell you that you need to provide a container and a SAS Token QueryString. Through some interweb sleuthing, I was able to find this page: Azure IoT Device Management in Bulk - where I discovered that the exportBlobContainerUri had to have a SAS Token QueryString. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a sample that we could run to show us everything we need to do to consume the REST API? Yes, it would, continue reading… I’m a huge fan of Postman as a REST API usage communcation mechanism, not just a REST API execution engine. I want to be able to post a URL to my Postman collection, have you run it and you see actual requests being executed with live data, accurate JSON payloads, headers, response codes…everything. The problem comes when you need to do things like generate SAS tokens to be embedded in JSON payload. At first, I wanted to code the SAS Token generation myself in the Postman Pre-request Script block, but I gave up because I couldn’t get the SAS token stringToSign just right. SAS generation is complex and the documentation is incorrect. So, then I tried using an Azure Function that my Postman collection could call to get the SAS token. But that violated my rule of no other HTTP dependencies. So, then I was back to the Pre-request Script block, but this time I had an idea to borrow the SAS token generation code from the official Azure Storage Node SDK and convert it to a one-script-file that could be copied and pasted into the Pre-request Script block. The problem with that approach is that the Postman Pre-request Script block is a sandbox that only allows certain npm packages, like lodash, crypto-js and a few others. The Azure Storage Node SDK uses a lot more than that and different packages, like underscore and crypto. You can find all of the SAS related code in the Azure Storage Node SDK here: Azure Storage Node SDK SAS Token Code. My first step in figuring this out was to see if I could convert the Azure Storage SDK to use lodash and crypto-js so it could work with Postman. It took me a couple of hours, but I got all of the non-Postman-compatible dependencies ripped out and got it to work. The next step was making it easy for a consumer to reuse the SAS code in their own Postman projects. I refacted all of the code into a single file and pushed it out to a new GitHub repo: azure-sas-tokens-postman. The full steps for generating the Azure Storage SAS Token are in the GitHub readme, but the gist is: 1. Copy the azure-sas-tokens-postman/azure-storage/azure-storage-sas-postman.js file to Postman Pre-request Script sandbox. 2. Set some environment variables: account-name, account-key, container-name. 3. Execute the request and use the SAS Token QueryString in subsequent requests. Here’s a complete example using the Azure IoT Export Device REST API. Azure IoT Export Devices Example 1. Open Postman and setup the AAD Token As described in this blog post: How to Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) Access Tokens in Postman 2. Create a new Postman request and copy the following URL into the URL textbox https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/resourceGroups/:resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/:resourceName/exportDevices?api-version=&#123;&#123;api-version&#125;&#125; 3. Copy the azure-storage-sas-postman.js file to the Pre-request Script sandbox. 4. Copy the following JSON payload into the body tab: &#123; \"exportBlobContainerUri\": \"https://&#123;&#123;device-storage-account-name&#125;&#125;.blob.core.windows.net/devices?&#123;&#123;device-export-sas-querystring&#125;&#125;\", \"excludeKeys\": \"false\"&#125; Make sure you select ‘raw’ and ‘application\\json’ 5. Create the following Postman environment keys: You will add these as new keys. Use name, key and container values from your Azure Storage account. device-storage-account-name:jongiothubdeviceexport device-storage-account-key:R+Jdx5k+O7bIjCJD8zQF3/bCALFyZjqZWz/pVdtNZqn2O/+HA+0CAZGVuKz3tqh7Lw== device-export-postman-env-variable-name:device-export-sas-querystring device-storage-container:devices You will have these from the AAD/Postman blog post, more on that here. subscriptionId:f9766876-e50b-436f-9ad3-5afb7bb8cf45 resourceGroupName:jongrg resourceName:jongiothub api-version:2016-02-03 clientId:483d39c4-7124-47fc-b5e0-4745d0887fc5 clientSecret:DvtpVwsoZvKJ/+gXQk+5CGRGR7IWU2za tenantId:72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47 6. Verify that you have the ‘Authorization’ and ‘Content-Type’ headers set. 7. Send the request and you will see the following output: &#123; \"jobId\": \"07dca1d9-eee1-4776-9b9a-1a57fb97d93b\", \"startTimeUtc\": \"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 05:27:16 GMT\", \"type\": \"export\", \"status\": \"enqueued\", \"progress\": 0, \"outputBlobContainerUri\": \"https://jongiothubdeviceexport.blob.core.windows.net/devices?st=2017-03-13T04%3A50%3A20Z&amp;se=2017-03-13T05%3A50%3A20Z&amp;sp=rwd&amp;sv=2016-05-31&amp;sr=c&amp;sig=EqSy2N9YEBXowyEqBQ%2FGv1mrmOZ67%2F80dr%2BKNUvI%3D\", \"excludeKeysInExport\": false, \"useSecondaryStorageAsSource \": false&#125; 8. Then, using Azure Storage Explorer, view your devices.txt file. Postman Collection Runner I’ll blog more about this soon, but the real beauty of Postman is that it gives you the ability to execute all requests in a collection and using their Collection runner like this: Newman Postman Collection Runner (on Server) You can then fully automate your REST API tests with newman on the server. This command: newman run \"Blog Samples.postman_collection.json\" -e \"Blog Samples.postman_environment.json\" Will execute all your requests in the collection and give you a pass/fail output like this: Like I mentioned before, I’m not quite done with the Azure IoT REST in Postman project, but I will continue to blog after I reach each milestone.

For the purposes of this blog post, we are going to create a very simple radio button control to demonstrate the components needed to create a slicer. I also created a much more sophisticated “Range Slider” control that you can find here: PowerBI-visuals-rangeSlider See my How to Get Started with Power BI Custom Visuals for general custom visual development tutorials. You can download the source for this visual here: PowerBI-visuals-radioSlicer You can download the visual to use in reports here: Download Radio Slicer Here’s what this custom visual will look like when you are done with this tutorial. Here’s what the icon looks like in the visualization pane: Step 0: Create Data Set Create a dataset that has the following structure: Values 1 2 3 4 You can use Power BI Desktop, Excel, Streaming Datasets, SQL or whatever you prefer. I’ve provided an excel spreadsheet here that you can use. Just import it into Power BI using the web interface, or use Power BI Desktop and Publish it to the web. Step 1: Create Visual: pbiviz new If you have no idea what pbiviz new means, then see my How to Get Started with Power BI Custom Visuals for general custom visual development tutorials. pbiviz new radioSlicer Open this folder in VS Code or your preferred IDE. Step 2: Update Settings: capabilities.json Open capabilities.json and add replace its contents with the following json. This file: Adds a single Grouping data property, which will get us the categories needed for filtering Adds the “General-&gt;filter” format property which allows this visual to participate in filtering capabilities. Adds a “top” number so we get the max categories allowed by Power BI. Right now that number is 30k categories max, but I set to 100000 for fun. Step 3: Create Code: visual.ts The meat of the visual lives in visual.ts. Rather than explain each piece individually, I’m including the full code file below with bullets that describe what is going on. 1. Instantiate an ISelectionManager object in constructor 2. Extract categories from Power BI data model 3. Loop through categories and create a “selectionId” for each of them. SelectionIds are objects that you pass to the SelectionManager’s select method. It contains the metadata needed to filter. 4. Loop through each value and inject a new radio button into the DOM for each value. 5. Add an onclick event handler to each radio button that grabs the matching selectionId, selects it and then calls applySelectionFilter(). Note: You can only filter on categories, not values, and you are limited to 30k categories. Step 4: Package: pbiviz package Run the following command to package the visual and share it as a pbiviz file. pbiviz package Hopefully this post helps you get started building slicer visuals.

Of course, you are going to want to use Apiary to officially describe your APIs, but if you really want to demonstrate exact calls and provide guidance on how to use the APIs in a personal manner, it doesn’t get any better than sending over a Postman Collection file and asking them to run that inside of Postman or Newman. Within the file they are able to see the exact URIs, parameters, headers that you use to accomplish their scenario. They can then take that guidance and convert it to whatever technology best suits their application needs. I’m working with a customer that needs to use the Azure IoT Hub REST APIs to work with Device Twins (a cloud representation of your IoT device). You can read more about Device Twins here and see the official REST API docs here. A few days ago I forwarded the documentation over to the customer and they struggled with trying to figure out how to use the APIs. There’s a lot missing from the docs and it is mostly generated from comments. My recommendation back to the Azure IoT team is going to be to use Apiary and provide very clear and concise code samples for common scenarios. Many customers have to use the REST APIs because of the memory constrained devices and they want complete control over the interation with IoT Hub - REST APIs should be treated as first class citizens and Postman/Newman/Apiary help do so. Given that I needed to resolve this customer issue right away, I could not take the time to update the documentation, but wanted to get them the help they needed ASAP. This is the perfect use case for Postman/Newman. So, I jumped into Postman, created a new collection, wrote a pre-request script to generate a SAS token and then demonstrated how to use the APIs. I then used Newman to script the test runs from the command line. This post will bring you through how I did that. We will go through how to GET a Device Twin document as well as PATCH it to include a desired property. Get Postman Download Postman from http://getpostman.com (I’m using Windows, but feel free to use whatever version works for you.) Create a New Postman Collection Postman allows you to organize your REST API calls into collections and then share those collections. I created a collection called “Azure IoT Hub Device Twins” Setup Postman Environment Postman allows you to setup environments that allow you to set and get global variables. This is where we are going to set the variables we need for these calls. Click on the eye icon in the upper right. There you will see that you can configure the variables you need for your script. In the Device Twin case, you need to set the following: hubName - The name of your IoT Hub from the Azure portal. deviceId - The name of your device signingKey - The iothubowner key form the Azure Portal expiresInMins - The number of minutes you want to use the token for policyName - The access policy to use - set to iothubowner for Device Twin scenario deviceName - The second step of this script PATCHES the device twin metadata, it will use this name. Enter anything you want. Add Pre-request Script to Generate SAS Token Azure IoT Hub requires you to supply an Authorization header when you call the REST endpoints. You can read more about the requirements for that token on the IoT Hub Security Guide. The Authorization header has the following format: SharedAccessSignature sr=jongiothub.azure-devices.net&amp;sig=ZiyjB%2FWuGrG43%2BkfuE07w3iC6em8eluH918%2Bi1F46Uo%3D&amp;se=1486605666&amp;skn=iothubowner The parameters are: sr - The resource uri sig - The URI encoded base64 encoded signature se - The TTL for the token skn - The policy name We are going to use the Postman Pre-request Script feature to generate the token. You’ll notice that that under the URI, there’s a Pre-request script tab. Click that tab and enter the following code to generate the SAS token and put it in a Postman global variable. You can read the comments to try to decipher how each component is generated. Add API Calls The Postman main development area allows you to enter URIs, parameters, headers, Pre-request scripts and Tests. For the first example we are going to start with the “GET Device Twin” call, which just gets the device twin (cloud representation of the device metadata). The URI to get the device twin is in the following format: https://&#123;&#123;hubName&#125;&#125;.azure-devices.net/twins/&#123;&#123;deviceId&#125;&#125;?api-version=2016-11-14 Notice that Postman uses a double-curly syntax for variables. With every Azure IoT Hub API call you need to include the api-version and Authorization header. You can read more about IoT Hub security here. The api-version is pretty straight forward and you can get the most recent version that you should use from the Common parameters and headers page. The Authorization header is a Shared Access Signature that follows very strict, but not very well documented requirements. You can read more about that above. Add GET Device Twin Call 1. Enter the URI, in this case: https://.azure-devices.net/twins/?api-version=2016-11-14 2. Add ‘Authorization’ header and set the value to {{token}} - that tells Postman to read that value from the global variables you just set in your Pre-request script. 3. Click on the “Tests” tab and enter the following: tests[\"Body matches string\"] = responseBody.has(postman.getGlobalVariable(\"deviceId\")); This test will pass if it finds the deviceId that is stored in the global variable. 3. Click Send and view the output. It will look something like this: And you will see that the tests pass: Add PATCH Device Twin Call 1. Create a new call by clicking the + sign tab. You can also duplicate the GET call, but remove the Pre-request script if you do that. 2. The URI is the same as the GET call https://&#123;&#123;hubName&#125;&#125;.azure-devices.net/twins/&#123;&#123;deviceId&#125;&#125;?api-version=2016-11-14 3. Select “PATCH” verb. 4. Set the Authorization and Content-Type headers 5. Set the body to the following: 6. Create the following test: tests[\"Body matches string\"] = responseBody.has(postman.getGlobalVariable(\"deviceName\")); 7. Click send and you should now see the deviceName property in the JSON result. And your Test should pass: Run the Tests in Postman Collection Runner Postman includes an app that allows you to run all the tests in a collection at once. 1. Click on the toggle arrow next to the collection name and click Run 2. That will bring up the Collection Runner, Click Start Run after selecting your Collection 3. Your tests will run and you’ll see pass/fail for all of them. Run the Tests in Newman Newman is Postman’s Node.js serverside Collection execution engine. It takes in a Collection definition a reference to the global variables and then executes the job. 1. Install Newman npm i -g newman 2. Download the Postman Collection File Expand the Collection Toggle, click the … button, then Click Export and save that file to your machine. 3. Download the Global Variables File. Go back to your Environments, click Edit, then click the “Download as JSON” button. 4. Open CMD and run the following: newman run \"Azure IoT Hub Device Twins.postman_collection.json\" -g globals.postman_globals.json Change the file names to match the file names you downloaded earlier. You will then see the following output showing that the tests have passed. I hope this posts helps you get started with Postman/Newman as well as the Azure IoT Hub Device Twin REST APIs.

The issue was that the Bluetooth Settings dialog did not allow you to re-connect a previously paired Bluetooth device. You had to use the old ‘Playback devices’ dialog as a workaround. You can read more about that here, if you are interested. Windows has finally solved the problem once and for all with a brand new Bluetooth Settings dialog. The new dialog will eventually be part of Windows proper, but for now you have to be part of the Windows Insider program and install at least version 15007. I believe the new APIs appeared with this update: See the full version history here Here’s the new dialog: As you can see there are a lot of improvements to the layout.

Here’s a quick post that goes through why and how I made the swtich. 2/22/2017 Update: T-Mobile just introduced the 2 lines for $100 plan, so T-Mobile is now $480/year less expensive than AT&amp;T. Why I Switched from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile I’ve been an AT&amp;T customer for 14 years and have been relatively happy with their phone service and their customer service has been fine for me. But I’ve been recently traveling outside of the US a lot and could have really used data and phone during those trips. AT&amp;T international plans are ridiculously expensive, so I could never bring myself to do that. I’ve heard horror stories of people being charged thousands of dollars just because they turned on their phone in a different country. So, I just kept my phone in Airplane mode anytime I was out of the US. I was hestitant to switch because everyone says the T-Mobile coverage isn’t as good as AT&amp;T and I didn’t want to lose my AT&amp;T grandfathered unlimited data plan. But AT&amp;T recently informed me that my plan was going to go up by $5 a line. I have two lines, so that’s an additional $120 a year. I reached out to AT&amp;T and they said there’s nothing they can do and they would understand if I switched to T-Mobile. The base T-Mobile plan is $120 for two lines and that includes unlimited everything. After the AT&amp;T price increase I would be paying $140 with AT&amp;T. So, that’s $240 more a year to stay with AT&amp;T with less features. If I were to try to get an equivalent AT&amp;T plan it would be at least $200 a month - and that would require me to signup for DirectTV, which I don’t want. I recently took a trip to Japan, so I figured it would be the perfect time to try out T-Mobile and see if the coverage and international data plan worked well. T-Mobile gives you a try out period of 15 days. If you cancel service before 15 days, they will refund you the sign-up fee of $20 per line. T-Mobile was also running a promo that gives me a $150 pre-paid credit card per line. So, that’s an extra $300. Here’s what I like about the T-Mobile plan: 1. Unlimited data, voice and text. While I had unlimited data with AT&amp;T, I was still only at 200 texts a month and 500 voice minutes a month. 2. Personal hotspot - This allows me to use my phone as a mobile hotspot, so I can have internet on my laptop. I have already used this a bunch. 3. Simple pricing - $120/month includes all taxes and fees. It’s basically a set price for unlimited everything and then you pay more if you want faster international speeds. Given that I’m only going to use international data to book Ubers, Maps and Yelp, etc. I don’t really need faster than 2G for that. Here’s what I don’t like about T-Mobile: 1. Data speeds: They are about half of what AT&amp;T is. From my house AT&amp;T is about 60mbps and T-Mobile about 25mbps. It is a noticeable difference when using the phone, but I’m on WiFi most of the time at home and work and I haven’t had any streaming issues on my commute, so I’m able to deal with the speed difference. And it’s not a big enough difference for me to stay with AT&amp;T. 2. Coverage: I noticed that T-Mobile has a lot fewer bars than AT&amp;T. In my home it is about 1-2 bars, while AT&amp;T is 4-5. I knew going into this decision that I would have to give up some coverage, but it hasn’t been a serious issue for me yet. How I Signed up for T-Mobile 1. Make sure your phone is unlocked. AT&amp;T will do this for you without any repercussions. You can request that your phone be unlocked via the AT&amp;T website’s Device Unlock Page. It took about 24 hours for mine to be unlocked and I got an email notification when it was complete. They recommend allowing 24-48 hours. 2. Stop by a local T-Mobile shop. They will test your phone to make sure it is unlocked and sign you up for a plan. I was in and out of the store in 20 minutes. Make sure you sign up for temporary numbers. Don’t port your numbers until you have tried out the service for a few weeks to make sure it works for you. How I Ported My Numbers from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile After trying out T-Mobile for a few weeks I decided to make the switch. I was really hard to pass up unlimited everything, including international data for $20 less a month than what I was paying with AT&amp;T. From my phone I just dialed 611 and told them I want to port my numbers. I gave them my AT&amp;T numbers and they ported them in a few minutes. I restarted my phones and everything was working just fine. Hope this helps you think through whether or not you should make the switch and how to do so.

I’ve blogged about this before, but I’ve simplified my re-connect process. I have heard this has been fixed in the latest Windows Insider build, but I haven’t had a chance to check that out yet. I’ll do another post when it is fixed for good. Here’s how I do it now. Pair Bluetooth Device 1. Put your device in pairing mode. See your device’s manual for details on how to do that. Most of the time it involves holding down a button until an LED flashes red and blue. 2. Hit the Windows key and type in Blue, then click on Bluetooth settings. 3. Make sure Bluetooth is on. 4. Find the device you want to pair. Click on it once. Then click the Pair button. 5. The device will pair and you will now see “Paired” under the device and a “Remove device” button. You device will now be connected. If you right-click on the audio icon in the task bar and select “Playback devices”, you will now see your device. Connect Bluetooth Device Since the new Bluetooth settings dialog does not allow you to re-connect to an audio device, you have to use the audio control panel dialog. Here’s the fastest way to get there: 1. Put your device in pairing mode. See your device’s manual for details on how to do that. Most of the time it involves holding down a button until an LED flashes red and blue. 2. Right-click on the audio icon in your taskbar and select Playback devices. 3. Find your device in the dialog. Right-click on it and select Connect. Your device then be connected to your PC.

It took us a while to figure it out and ran into a bunch of issues. Here’s how we got it working. Create Azure IoT Hub and Register a Device Create an Azure IoT Hub Register an Azure IoT Hub Device. Copy the Device’s connection string, you’ll need it later. Enable Azure IoT Hub File Upoads After you created your IoT Hub, you need to enable file uploads on the Azure Portal. I’m sure you can do via cli as well, but I don’t have time to research that right now. 1. Open the Azure Portal and navigate to the IoT Hub you created. 2. Click Messaging -&gt; File Upload 3. Create a new or select an existing Standard storage account. Make sure you create or use a Standard storage account. For some reason, file upload doesn’t work with Premium storage accounts. I’m following up with the team on that. 4. Create a container and click Select. Make sure you click the Select button to select that container to use in File Upload. 5. On the File Upload blade, Turn on &quot;Receive notifications for uploaded files&quot; 6. Click Save Make sure you click Save and that you see your container listed in the Storage container box. Get Python IDE You’ll need an IDE if you want to debug and step-through the code. I use VS Code and this Python extension. Install Azure IoT Python SDK Raspberry Pi If you are running this on a Raspberry PI, then you will likely need to build the SDK locally. Other Follow the instructions here to get the Python SDK on your machine. You can use pip or compile it yourself. Get Python Sample 1. Clone the Python SDK git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git Run Python Sample 0. Open a command prompt. 1. Navigate to the device/samples folder. 2. Open a command prompt and execute the following command: Replace [device connection string] with the device’s (NOT iotowner) connection string that you copied in step 1 above. python iothub_client_sample_class.py -p mqtt -c \"[device connection string]\" If everything is setup correctly, you will see the following message: Blob upload confirmation[1001] received for message with result = OKTotal calls confirmed: 1 Code Details Here’s the meat of the code for this sample. def upload_to_blob(self, destinationfilename, source, size, usercontext): self.client.upload_blob_async( destinationfilename, source, size, self._blob_upload_confirmation_callback, usercontext) And here’s the code that calls that method: filename= \"hello_python_blob.txt\"content = \"Hello World from Python Blob APi\"hub_manager.upload_to_blob(filename, content, len(content), 1001) If you want to upload files, you need to read them into memory first like this: filename = \"myimage.png\"f = open(\"C:\\Temp\\myimage.png\", \"rb\")content = f.read()print(\"IoTHubClient is uploading blob to storage\")iotHubClient.upload_blob_async(filename, content, len(content), blob_upload_confirmation_callback, 1001) File Upload Notifications Please reference the following article to learn how to handle the File Upload Notification event on the server-side. This is helpful when you want to kick-off a backend process when a file has been uploaded. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-java-java-file-upload#receive-a-file-upload-notification Troubleshooting 1. Invalid Syntax If you see the following error…you will need to open up the sample file in your IDE and add a comma after ‘size’ like this: File \"iothub_client_sample_class.py\", line 158 self._send_reported_state_callback, user_context) ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax 2. Unable to IoTHubClient_LL_UploadToBlob 1. You don’t have a storage account associated with your IoT Hub. 2. You are using a “Premium Storage” Account. Solution: Change your storage account to Standard Storage. 3. You didn’t click Save on the File Upload Blob. Make sure the File Upload pane has your Storage container listed.

HTTPAPI_ExecuteRequest Line:552 curl_easy_perform() failed: Out of memory This is due to a bug in the Azure IoT Python SDK. The issue is being tracked on GitHub here. In the meantime, you can use the sample code found here: https://github.com/jongio/azure-iot-rest. You will find a Python sample that shows you how to upload files via the Azure IoT REST APIs. 4. ImportError: libboost_python-py27.so.1.55.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory This is due to the SDK being built with references that you don’t currently have on your machine. Follow the instructions here to build the SDK on the machine you will be running it on. I got it work on a Raspberry Pi 3 / Stretch. Make sure you use the --recursive flag when you clone. View The File You can use Azure Storage Explorer to view the uploaded file. If you go to the storage account that you associated with IoT Hub in Azure Portal, you’ll see an Open in Storage Explorer button. Drill down to your container and you’ll see your file. Access The File If you want a direct URL to the file it will look like this: https://jongiothubstandard.blob.core.windows.net/blobcontainer/foo/hello_python_blob.txt You’ll need to replace your storage name, container name and then build the rest of the path based on the parameters you passed to the upload method when you uploaded the file. Hope this works for you. Let me know if you run into any issues.

People typically create Workspace Collections via the Azure Portal, but that requires clicks and take more time than just doing it in the command line. IMPORTANT: You cannot get the Power BI Embedded Access Keys using this method. I’m working with the CLI team to get that implemented soon. In the mean-time, you have to go to the portal to get the Access Keys. 1. Install Python You need Python to install azure-cli via pip. 1. Install Python 2.7 from here: 2. Make sure you choose to include Python in your PATH: 2. Install Azure CLI 1. Open a command prompt and execute the following: pip install --user azure-cli You will see this when it is finished: 3. Add Python Scripts to PATH 1. Find a path similar to this one: C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Scripts add it to your environment PATH variable. I say ‘similar’ because it might be under ‘AppData’ local or under the versioned Python folder inside of ‘Roaming’ You will see the following when you open that path in Windows Explorer. Notice “az”. If you don’t see that, then the pip install didn’t work. 4. Test az 1. Close all your command prompts, open a new one and run the following: az You will see the following output: 5. Login to Azure 1. Run the following command to login: az login You will see a message like the following: To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code BVVHR4DRF to authenticate. 2. Go to that URL, enter that code, login with the same account that is assigned to your Azure subscription and then come back to the command prompt. You will see your Azure Subscription metadata in JSON format. 6. Set Current Subscription This will make sure the Power BI Embedded Resource is created in the right subscription. It sets the subscription as the “current” subscription to any further command will be executed against that subscription. 1. Run the following command to set the current subscription Replace {subscription id} with your Azure subscription id az account set --subscription &#123;subscription id&#125; 2. Run the following command to test if the current subscription is correct: az account show 7. Create an Azure Resource Group You can either create a new one or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing one skip to the next step. 1. To create a new Resource Group, execute the following command. Replace ‘westus’ with your desired location and replace ‘jong-rg1’ with your desired Resource Group name. az group create -l westus -n jong-rg1 8.

I started as a Dev in Windows, then Dev Lead for the Learning Platform, then Dev Lead in MSDN, then Dev Lead in Bing, then a Dev Lead at MSN, then a Dev Manager for MSN.com, then a Dev Manager in Advertising, then an SDE in Windows IoT, then a Dev Manager in Power BI and now an SDE on the Developer Experience team. In a nutshell, Dev -&gt; Dev Lead -&gt; Dev Manager -&gt; Dev -&gt; Dev Manager - Dev. (My experience is proof that Microsoft supports moves from Individual Contributor to Manager and allows people to move around the company) It has been an amazing journey through almost all of the Microsoft divisions. I love being a Dev Manager, but I also love being a well rounded engineer who is deeply connected with our customers. While I was Dev Manager of Power BI Embedded, I got to witness some of the work that the Developer Experience team does and knew right away that it was what I wanted to do for the next phase of my career. I’ve been in this role for 6 months, which is long enough for me to know that I want to stay in this role for as long as they’ll have me. It truly is a dream job for me. It’s the perfect mix of coding, problem solving, community engagement and customer interaction. We’re looking for a Senior SDE to focus on microservices, which will involve services and technologies like Azure Functions, Service Fabric, Kubernetes, DC/OS and the serverless space in general. Here’s what the role entails: 1. You are an expert in a particular technology, in this role’s case: microservices. My focus is IoT and Data Visualization, which means I focus on Azure IoT and Power BI Custom Visuals and Power BI Embedded. By being an expert, that means you are called upon by customers, employees and the product teams when they need expert opinions and contributions. You are brought into customer hackfests as the domain expert. Once you become an expert, you will be asked to speak at events or do webcasts for that technology. It’s not something you need to chase after. If you are doing your job right, the folks will ask you to present and share your knowledge. As an expert, you will help drive meaningful change to the product team based on customer feedback. 2. You own communicating customer feedback from Developer Experience engagements directly to the product team. We have a formal process for logging feedback from customers and then present that feedback to the product team on a regular basis. The high-pri issues are escalated up to our CEO on a regular basis. You are responsible for helping the product team establish a prioritization for that feedback. 3. You will develop stopgap solutions for any holes that are found in the product. For example, IoT Hub does not currently support decompression on the backend, so I helped develop a sample that shows customers how to use the Field Gateway to compress messages and then Azure Functions to decompress the messages and forward them to another Event Hub. You will then push that stopgap to GitHub for the customer and the general public to consume. In addition to building a stopgap, you will work with the product team to help get that feature implemented into the product. 4. You will represent your technology in cross-team technical working groups. You will update senior leaders on the lay of the land in that technical area and report on product feedback and related hackfests. You will also help coordinate regular meetings and help up-skill many folks across the Developer Experience team. 5. You will develop workshops and code used to train internal and external folks, such as Technical Evangelists and MVPs. For example, our team just hosted an IoT Workshop for MVPs at the MVP Summit. 6. You will travel to customer sites around the world to help them implement prototypes to jump-start their development efforts. Travel isn’t required, but I’ve found that once I got into this role and travelled a few times it is now something I love doing. You should be open to the possibility of travel. 7. You will need to be an excellent communicator as you will be discussing technology with everyone from Devs all the way to CEOs. 8. This is a very self-directed role. We’re a small team of developers that are very self-directed. You have to be comfortable figuring out what you should work on. You’ll have a team to lean on when you need to, but no one is going to tell you exactly what to do. You, as the expert, need to figure out what is important for that domain and do it. 9. You will share all of this knowledge via your blog or official product documentation, so you must be able to write clear and concise technical docs and it would help if you enjoyed doing that. 10. Relocation: You always ask…It helps to be here in Redmond, but not required. We’ll take on a case-by-case basis. Try to convince us if you absolutely cannot relocate. This role is right for you if you want to drive meaningful change into Microsoft products based on real-world customer engagements.

Unfortunately “filtering” is not currently supported in the new Power BI Custom Visual SDK, but should be in the next couple of months. Since this customer is already using Power BI Embedded, I suggested that they use the new Power BI Embedded JavaScript API to send filter commands from the hosting webpage to the embedded Power BI report. It wasn’t as easy as it should be to get this implemented. There’s the new demo site, that helped with syntax, but it doesn’t allow you to change the filters. I hacked a version together that does allow you to edit the filter text, but uses JavaScript eval(), so the PR was denied, but the code still works. You can find my fork here: jongio / PowerBI-JavaScript. You can find all of the working code from this walkthrough here: jongio / powerbi-embedded-javascript-api-range-slider-filter. Create Report in Power BI Desktop The first thing you are going to want to do is create a Power BI report using Power BI Desktop that you can later embed and filter. For this example, we are going to use a very simple table. You can download this sample pbix from GitHub here: powerbi-embedded-sample.pbix I added a simple pie chart 1. Open Power BI Desktop. Create a table and enter some data. 2. Save the .pbix file for later. Create Power BI Embedded Assets in Azure The topology of the Power BI Embedded implementation is as follows: Power BI Workspace Collections contain Power BI Workspaces which contain Reports. You create the Workspace Collection on Azure and then use the Node.js CLI to add Workspaces to the Collection and then add Reports to the Workspace. You’ll get the Access Key from the Azure Portal under the Workspace Collection. Create Power BI Workspace Collection You have 3 options to create a Power BI Workspace Collection: 1. Azure CLI 1.0 This allows you to create the Workspace Collection without having to use the Azure Portal. Following this tutorial to create the Workspace Collection, get your Access Key and then come back to this post. How to Create a Power BI Embedded Workspace Collection with the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) 1.0 2. Azure Portal 1. Go to the Azure Portal and create a new Power BI Workspace Collection. 2. Copy your Access Key to Notepad, you’ll need it later. 3. Azure CLI 2.0 This option allows you to create the Power BI Workspace Collection, but there is currently no way to get the Access Keys via the CLI 2.0. I do not recommend this approach at this time, but it will be the way going forward. I will update this post once that support is added. How to Create a Power BI Embedded Workspace Collection with the new Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) 2.0 Install the Power BI CLI You just created the Workspace Collection, now we’ll create the Workspaces in that collection. npm i -g powerbi-cli Create Power BI Workspace powerbi create-workspace -c pbiejssample -k vq+0LR5JIod/7ztPI1iTWAqpc9dGVZWxsNSls8a2EORS43536VS0v275RBJMIMFB91/sHmxz7nJC+w2YOSixDA== Replace -c value with your collection name Replace -k with the Access Key for your Workspace Collection you created earlier.

Please see full example below for a version that works in IE. You declared a div: reportContainer You referenced the powerbi.min.js file. You setup some variables to hold the token and reportId you created earlier You called powerbi.embed to bind the report to the div. You should now see your report embedded into the webpage. You can use http-server to serve the current folder from localhost. npm i -g http-server Filter Report with Range Slider We are now going to filter the report with a jQuery UI Slider control. 1. Install the jquery and jquery-ui npm packages npm i jquery --savenpm i jqueryui --savenpm i es6-promise --save 2. Reference the jquery and jquery-ui js and the css. // before end of &lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=\"./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=\"./node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=\"./node_modules/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;// in &lt;head&gt;&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.css\"&gt; 3. Add a new div to your html page &lt;div id=\"slider\" /&gt; 4. Add a new filter method to be called when your filter changes. You can learn all about the JavaScript API here. The important thing to observe here is the table and column values. Those are set to match the table and column names you created in Power BI Desktop earlier. The code will construct a filter based on the value passed to it and call the setFilters method on the report. function filter(values) &#123; const filter = &#123; $schema: \"http://powerbi.com/product/schema#basic\", target: &#123; table: \"Data\", column: \"Value\" &#125;, operator: \"In\", values: values &#125;; var report = powerbi.embeds[0]; if (report) &#123; report.setFilters([filter]) .then(function (result) &#123; console.log(result); &#125;) .catch(function (errors) &#123; console.log(errors); &#125;); &#125;&#125; 6. Instantiate the slider $(e =&gt; &#123; $(\"#slider\").slider(&#123; min: 3, max: 5, step: 1, slide: function (event, ui) &#123; filter([ui.value]); &#125; &#125;);&#125;); 7. When you now run the webpage you will see a slider control at the top and when you select “3” it will filter the pie chart to only those value that are equal to “3” Here’s a full working sample that you should be able to just copy and paste into your application after install the npm packages. &lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Power BI Embedded with Filtering Sample&lt;/title&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.css\"&gt; &lt;style&gt; #slider &#123; width: 500px; &#125; #reportContainer &#123; height: 500px; &#125; #custom-handle &#123; width: 1.6em; height: 1.6em; top: 50%; margin-top: -.8em; text-align: center; line-height: 1.6em; &#125; &lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=\"slider\"&gt; &lt;div id=\"custom-handle\" class=\"ui-slider-handle\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=\"reportContainer\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script src=\"./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=\"./node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=\"./node_modules/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=\"./node_modules/powerbi-client/dist/powerbi.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; $(function () &#123; var handle = $(\"#custom-handle\"); $(\"#slider\").slider(&#123; min: 1, max: 25, step: 1, create: function () &#123; handle.text($(this).slider(\"value\")); &#125;, slide: function (event, ui) &#123; handle.text(ui.value); filter([ui.value]); &#125; &#125;); (function () &#123; var embedToken = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ2ZXIiOiIwLjIuMCIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYW5hbHlzaXMud2luZG93cy5uZXQvcG93ZXJiaS9hcGkiLCJpc3MiOiJQb3dlciBCSSBOb2RlIFNESyIsIndjbiI6InBiaWVqc3NhbXBsZSIsIndpZCI6ImQ2NmQ4ZTQyLWI5MmEtNDU3Ni05MDcyLWZiYWFmYjg3MmFlNyIsInJpZCI6IjQ5NjRhOTQ3LTg1N2YtNGMxNC05MTRkLWM2NmUxYzU3MTNjZCIsIm5iZiI6MTQ4MzY2MTY4OSwiZXhwIjoxNDgzNjY1Mjg5fQ.-g6Zh5AthZDCfZLEtvnl7mXDMBYjwauZyBORer--xb0'; var reportId = '4964a947-857f-4c14-914d-c66e1c5713cd'; var embedUrl = 'https://embedded.powerbi.com/appTokenReportEmbed?reportId=' + reportId; var config = &#123; type: 'report', accessToken: embedToken, embedUrl: embedUrl, id: reportId, settings: &#123; filterPaneEnabled: false, navContentPaneEnabled: false &#125; &#125;; powerbi.embed($('#reportContainer')[0], config); &#125;)(); &#125;); function filter(values) &#123; const filter = &#123; $schema: \"http://powerbi.com/product/schema#basic\", target: &#123; table: \"Data\", column: \"Value\" &#125;, operator: \"In\", values: values &#125;; var report = powerbi.embeds[0]; if (report) &#123; report.setFilters([filter]) .then(function (result) &#123; console.log(result); &#125;) .catch(function (errors) &#123; console.log(errors); &#125;); &#125; &#125; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Power BI","slug":"Tech/Power-BI","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Power-BI/"}],"tags":[{"name":"powerbi","slug":"powerbi","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/powerbi/"}]},{"title":"Beta Testers Needed for Particle to Azure IoT Integration","slug":"azureiotparticlebeta","date":"2016-12-19T13:07:09.000Z","updated":"2016-12-19T22:46:08.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/azureiotparticlebeta/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2016/12/azureiotparticlebeta/","excerpt":"","text":"Over the past couple of months, the Particle team and the Azure IoT team have been developing a integration between the two cloud services. Particle is an IoT company that launced on Kickstarter in 2013 and Azure IoT is a new IoT cloud service offering from Microsoft. IoT developers use Particle because their devices are inexpensive, easy to aquire and easy to connect to the cloud. I’ve been a fan of Particle for a long time and use the Particle Photon as the primary device in a workshop I teach at the Microsoft Garage. I’ve been in regular contact with the folks at Particle and recently stirred up a conversation about the integration possibilities between the two clouds. While it is possible to configure the Particle device to send data to Azure today, it isn’t as intuitive as it could be. The proper way to implement the integration is via Particle’s webhook infrastructure that allows you to forward messages to other HTTPS endpoints after the Particle cloud has received them. After a few meetings with the Particle folks, we decided that cloud-to-cloud integration was the best way to go. The Particle to Azure IoT integration is going to be useful in scenarios where you have a Particle device and want to take advantage of all the downstream Azure services, such as Azure Stream Analytics, Events Hubs and Power BI. If you are already using Particle and want your data in Azure IoT, this is for you. In a recent call with Particle, we talked about how to best get feedback on the integration beta and decided to send out a quick tweet with more information and ask people to kick the tires and provide some feedback. Particle to Azure IoT Setup We’d love your help testing it. Here’s how to get started: 1. Go to your Particle console here: https://console.particle.io/integrations and click on “New Integration”. 2. Select Azure IoT Hub. 3. Sign up for Azure, Create an IoT Hub and Add a new Shared Access Policy for this integration. 4. Enter IoT Hub information, select your device and enable the integration. 5. You can optionally use the “Send Custom JSON” feature to format the JSON to suit your application needs. See the “Webhook Variables” page for available token replacements. 6. Then implement code for your Particle device to publish and subscribe to events. It can be as simple as the following to publish an event named “temp” void loop() &#123; // Get some data String data = String(10); // Trigger the integration Particle.publish(\"temp\", data, PRIVATE); // Wait 60 seconds delay(60000);&#125; 7. You will start to see messages flowing into Particle via the Particle Console log and Azure IoT Device Explorer Provide Feedback Now that you have it all setup let us know what you think. Was it easy to configure? Was anything missing from the integration or the docs? Let us know what you think by posting to the Particle Community Forums You can find Particle on Twitter here: http://twitter.com/particleio and follow Azure IoT here: https://twitter.com/search?q=azureiot Jon","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Azure","slug":"Tech/Azure","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Azure/"}],"tags":[{"name":"azure","slug":"azure","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/azure/"},{"name":"iot","slug":"iot","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/iot/"}]},{"title":"Introducing Azure Iot Hub Routes - A New Feature That Allows You to Route Messages to Alternate Endpoints","slug":"azure-iot-hub-routes","date":"2016-12-14T15:44:00.000Z","updated":"2018-05-16T20:53:16.067Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/azure-iot-hub-routes/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2016/12/azure-iot-hub-routes/","excerpt":"","text":"The Azure IoT team just announced Custom Endpoints and Routes feature - which allows you to route IoT Hub messages to your own Event Hub, Service Bus Queues or Service Bus Topics. You define your alternate endpoints in “Endpoints” and you define your routing logic in “Routes”. Update #1: Routes Based on Message Payload You can now create routes based on message payload. You can read more about it here. What are Some Use Cases for Endpoints and Routes? This is very useful for customers that want to segregate messages for security or billing purposes. Imagine if you are using IoT Hub to build your own IoT SaaS product that has tenants. You will likely want to push all messages from each tenant into its own Event Hub so you can easily map Event Hub cost to a tenant. Endpoints and Routes is also a great way to integrate with other services, such as Logic Apps or Notification services or your own custom service. What Do Endpoints and Routes Do Under the Covers? When IoT Hub receives a message it first checks to see if there is a custom route available that matches a given rule. If there is a match it will send the message to that endpoint and not the Default Event Hub. How do I Use Endpoints and Routes? This video will walk you through the same exercise: Azure Portal You will now see Endpoints and Routes in your IoT Hub main screen. We will set both of them up starting with Endpoints. Define Your Endpoints Event Hub, Service Bus Queues and Service Bus Topics are supported today, but more will come in the future. The first thing you are going to want to do is create one of those if you don’t already have one. For this exercise, we’ll create an Event Hub. 1) Click on Endpoints You will see the Built-in endpoints at the top And right below that you will see “Additional Endpoints” and you can have up to 10 additional endpoints. 2) Click “Add” Over in the right hand panel, you will see the Add Endpoint screen. I selected Event Hub and as you can see I don’t have an Event Hub defined in the same region as my IoT Hub. 3) Create an Event Hub Open a new browser window and create an Event Hub in the same region as your IoT Hub, mine is East US. 4) Add Event Hub Endpoint Go back to the IoT Hub Endpoints blade and refresh. You should now see your Event Hub. Select it and click OK. You will now see it listed in “Additional Endpoints” Define Your Routes and Rules Click on “Routes” and you’ll see the empty rule list. You can have up to 100 rules per IoT Hub Click “Add” Give your rule a name, select your data source, add a query and select and endpoint to send the matching message to. The rule works against the IoT Hub message properties. It does not inspect the payload of the message. The IoT Hub team has said message inspection is on their backlog. Routes based on payload are now supported, read more here. You can find the Query String syntax docs here and here. As you can see below, you can send the messages directly to the events endpoint or to the custom endpoint you created. Click OK and you will now see your Route Rule Test It Out Download this node.js script to your machine. https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jongio/8f478cbce44960628482e0491d3dccb1/raw/1183b42f48a768e62420d58d3a7779a9062ab7fa/iothubnodesend Replace line 17 with your device’s connection string. You can create devices and get their connection strings using the IoT Device Explorer Scroll to line 39 and change any of the properties to suit your needs. Run the following to install the Azure IoT Node SDK npm i azure-iot-devicenpm i azure-iot-device-amqp 5. Open a command prompt and run the script node index.js You will now see this in your command prompt You will now see the messages coming through to your Event Hub. You can use the Service Bus Explorer to view them. I just clone that repo and F5 from VS to run the Service Bus Explorer. Notice in the Event Custom Properties section that tenant=1234 and location=sea, which is how we configured the message properties and how we setup the Route rule. Hope this helps you get started with the new and very useful feature.

In the lower right Open the optimized version and paste it into a variable in your Custom Visual like this: Then append the SVG to the DOM inside of your Custom Visual’s constructor method like this: You could also create the element with jQuery if you have that referenced. Run the visual using “pbiviz start” and you should now see the SVG version of the image PNG To reference a PNG, you have to encode it and reference as a background image in CSS. I chose base64 for this post, but other encodings should work as well. Find the Azure IoTHub_Color.png file from the icon set and use a site like Base64 Image Encoder to get the base64 encoding of it. Just upload the image, click “show code” and copy the “For use as CSS Background” code: In your Custom Visual project, open style/visual.less and create a new style like this: Open, src/visual.ts and add the following to the constructor You could also create the element with jQuery if you have that referenced.

Create GitHub Pages Repo Skip to next step if you already have a GitHub pages repo. 1. Create new GitHub repo 2. Under the repo settings &gt; GitHub Pages, set Source to the branch and Launch automatic page generator. 3. Clone the repo locally Copy Azure Deployment Files We need to get .deployment, deploy.cmd and getruby.cmd in the root of the GitHub repo. We are going to pull those files from here: https://github.com/ritterim/jekyll-azure-deploy. If you have Bash installed on Windows you can use the following command: If you don’t have bash, then figure out a way to get those files locally, i.e. clone that repo or download as a zip. After you have the files in the root of your repo locally, push them to your remote GitHub repo. Important: If you are deploying a Jekyll based site that precompiles files into a _site folder then you can leave these files as is. But, if you are deploying a static site without Jekyll, for example, the default HTML site that is generated by GitHub, then you are going to want to do the following: I repeat: Only do this next step if you have a static site that isn’t generated into a subfolder. Open deploy.cmd and find this line of code: and change %DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%/_site to %DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE% (remove /_site) Once you have made that change, make sure you push to your remote GitHub repo Create Azure WebSite Go to https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.WebSite and create your site. Increase Deployment Timeout Ruby takes a while to install the first time, so increase the deployment timeout with this setting. Open Azure Web App, Go to Application settings and add a custom setting called SCM_COMMAND_IDLE_TIMEOUT and set it to 3600 Make sure you click Save. Setup GitHub to Azure Deployment Hook Open Azure Web App, Go to “Deployment options” and select GitHub, Authorize and select your repo and branch and click OK. You will see this notification Click on “Deployment options” again and you should see that the site is being deployed: It will take a few minutes to complete.

They are included in the “objects” object at the same level as dataRoles and dataViewMappings. See this file for the complete example. The first child of the objects properties is the “property group”. In this example we have “text”, “circle” and “wave” groups. Each “property group” has a displayName property (that’s what will appear in the Power BI format pane) and a “properties” object. Each property has a displayName, description and type. (There are other properties as well, but we won’t get into that here). In the example below, you can see that a “color” is fill-&gt;solid-&gt;color:true. I’ve also included a numeric and bool sample ISSUE: Do not use “textSize” as a property key as is appears to be a reserved key by Power BI and it will always render the “text size” slider that defaults to a min value of 8. See this issue for updates on that. Here’s how that renders: The UI elements are dataType driven, so you automatically get the color selector when you set the type to fill-&gt;solid-&gt;color…same goes for bool, with the on/off switch. 2. Handle the setting of property values in enumerateObjectInstances method Power BI uses the enumerateObjectInstances method to map and store properties to an internal “metadata.objects” property. The enumerateObjectInstances method is called for every “property group” that you define in capabilities.json. You can see below that I have a case statement that matches the “key” from my “objects” in my capabilities.json file called “text”. This is where Power BI stores the values, so you want to assign each property to whatever value you have stored. I used a “settings” object to store these values. My visual needed the color in hex form, but when I save it to the Power BI metadata, it needs to be a “Fill” object, which is why I wrap it in {solid:{color: [value]}}. See visual.ts for complete example of this method. 3. Get property values with objectEnumerationUtility.js Now that you have the values stored in metadata, you’ll want to get the values out and use them in your visual. Power BI provides a sample .js file for doing so. I took their version and added a maxValue optional parameter: Add this file to your /src folder and update your tsconfig.json 4. Use a “settings” object as an in-memory property store that you use in your visual. Power BI recommends using TypeScript definitions and the visualTransform method for doing what I do here, but I didn’t want to take on anymore overhead than necessary and I wanted to try to do the least amount of code to do the conversion from an existing visual to a Power BI one. So, I just reused the settings object that was included with the original liquidFillGauge and am using the “getValue” method from objectEnumerationUtility.js. ISSUE: Power BI does not correctly update the options.type property when a “Style” object is changed. I’ll be able to remove some of the compare code when they fix this bug. I created a “getSettings” method that populates the settings object. You just pass in the metadata.object property, propertyGroup key, property key, default value and in some cases a maxValue. Take notice of how I deal with “color” based properties. I use the “Fill” type, wrap the default value in a json object and then call solid.color to get the value into the settings object. You won’t need to do it this way if you are creating from scratch and use the recommended ViewModel approach. I wanted to use the settings object as is and it uses hex, so that’s why I have to do that conversion. I went through and added properties to change just about every aspect of the liquid fill gauge….including being able to set difference colors for the wave, text and circle.

In this post I’m going to focus on the “capabilities” of the visual. Here’s the previous post: How to Create a Power BI Custom Visual Based on an Existing d3 Visual. It’s a liquidFillGauge that was originally created by Curtis Bratton. This is Part 2 of the series, here are the other posts: 1. How to Create a Power BI Custom Visual Based on an Existing d3 Visual - Part 1 - Dev Env Setup, Reference and Testing 3. How to Create a Power BI Custom Visual Based on an Existing d3 Visual - Part 3 - Custom Format Properties You can install this visual from the GitHub releases page here. I’ll put in the Power BI Visual Gallery once the visual is complete. I found this page helpful when looking into Power BI Custom Visual Data Roles. Here’s what the Liquid Fill Gauge looks like in Power BI. In the root of your project you have a capabilities.json file. This is where you define how the user can assign data to your visual. Each “dataRole” that you define in this file can be a “Grouping”, “Measure” or “GroupingOrMeasure” data role. I think about it like this: Grouping is like categories of data, sets of data, whereas Measure is a single value…GroupingOrMeasure is when the value can either be a Grouping or a Measure. In the case of the liquidFillGauge, we really only need to assign one value at this point - the fill percentage. The first version of the visual used the default capabilities.json file that comes with the template when created via “pbiviz new visualName”. The default capabilities comes with two dataRoles “Grouping” and “Measure” like so: Since we only need a single value (at the moment, but we might need more in the future). We can remove the Grouping field and change the name, like so: And if you just use that you’ll see this: What you need to do is define a dataViewMappings object that tells the visual how to represent the dataRoles in the dataView. Again, this is a super simple visual right now, so all we need to do is map the single value. I’ve seen examples where “role” is equal to “Values”, but removing it doesn’t seem to impact anything, so I’m leaving it as an empty string. You’ll also need to add the “object” property, I explain that in Part 3. Open capabilities.json and add this code: Your visualization pane should now look like this: And your format property pane will look like this: ![](/images/blog/2016-12-05 22_13_06-Power BI.png) The resulting visual is the same as the original. We just now have cleaner data and format panes….and less code.

I’ve been digging into the new Power BI Custom Visual SDK and just created my first visual called Liquid Fill Gauge. It is based off of Curtis Bratton’s Liquid Fill Gauge. Here’s how I did it… Custom Visual Series This is Part 1 of the series, here are the other posts: 2. How to Create a Power BI Custom Visual Based on an Existing d3 Visual - Part 2 - Capabilities, dataRoles and dataViewMappings 3. How to Create a Power BI Custom Visual Based on an Existing d3 Visual - Part 3 - Custom Format Properties You can download the visual and use within your reports here: https://github.com/jongio/PowerBI-visuals-liquidFillGauge/releases/ I walk through each step below – feel free to skim through it, use it as a reference or follow along step-by-step. Setup Power BI Custom Visual Dev Environment 1. Follow the instructions here to get your dev env setup: Power BI Documentation: Use developer tools to create custom visuals Clone Repo You can complete this exercise without cloning the repo, but if you want to get all the code and easily copy and paste, then you’ll want to clone. Part 1 Code: Here’s what your code will look like at the end of this blog post: https://github.com/jongio/PowerBI-visuals-liquidFillGauge-Part1 git clone https://github.com/jongio/PowerBI-visuals-liquidFillGauge-Part1.git Final Code: Here’s the final liquidFillGauge code: https://github.com/jongio/PowerBI-visuals-liquidFillGauge git clone https://github.com/jongio/PowerBI-visuals-liquidFillGauge.git Open Code I use VS Code, but feel free to use any editor. Create Custom Visual This uses the new SDK to create a custom visual template. This is what the dir structure looks like in VS Code. Reference d3 Typings You create Custom Visuals using TypeScript and d3, but d3 isn’t referenced by default in the new Custom Visual SDK. Here’s How to get it installed and referenced to make it visible to TypeScript. Go to this post for instructions on how to add d3 to your visual and then come back here: How to Add d3@v3.5.5 Reference to a Power BI Custom Visual (SDK v1.2) Add liquidFillGauge.js File 1. Create a file in the “src” folder called “liquidFillGauge.js”. 2. Copy the code from the following file into it. If you cloned the repo, you will have this file locally as well. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jongio/PowerBI-visuals-liquidFillGauge-Part1/master/liquidFillGauge/src/liquidFillGauge.js Notes The following is informational only, you do not need to make these changes. The original liquidFillGauge was pushed to GitHub as a stand alone d3 visual. I only had to change a the following two things for it to work with Power BI. Clip-Path PowerBI puts all Custom Visuals in IFRAMEs, so the clip-path needs to reference the absolute url of the page like so: d3 Instance Once I deployed my visual to PowerBI.com I ran into another IFRAME issue that required me to pass in the d3 selection instance, versus doing the d3.select inside the visual. Instead of passing in elementId, I pass in a reference to the svg element Add liquidFillGauge.js to pbiviz.json This will tell pbiviz to include the .js file in your project. 1. Open pbiviz.json and add a reference to liquidFillGauge.js to “externalJS” Add TypeScript Definition File The premise of this exercise is to take an existing d3 visual and easily turn it into a custom visual without having to rewrite the entire thing in TypeScript. What I would like to do is clone the existing visual and reference it from my visual.ts file. In order to do that, I need to make the visual file visible in TypeScript by creating a TypeScript definition file and including it in my project. 1. Create a new file in the “src” folder called “liquidFillGauge.d.ts” and add the following code to it. Add liquidFillGauge.d.ts files to tsconfig.json 1. Open tsconfig.json and add references to the liquidFillGauge.d.ts. This will tell pbiviz to include the TypeScript definition file in your project. Add liquidFillGauge to visual.ts The final step is to add code to the visual.ts file that will call the liquidFillGauge methods and create the visual. 1. Open visual.ts and copy the following code into it. I added another local variable to hold a reference to the gauge and then either call loadLiquidFillGauge for the first load or call this.gauge.update for subsequent calls. Test on PowerBI.com 1. Start your local server 2. Go to http://app.powerbi.com 3. Create a report that uses your visual 4. Map a data value to the “Measure Data” field. I’m using the Month column in the Dates table in the Customer Profitability Sample dataset. Make sure you select “Count of Month” and it is assigned to “Measure Data”, not “Category Data” 5. You should then see your custom visual rendered. If you do not see it, then compare your code to the code in this GitHub repo and fix anything that is different. – Hope this gets you on your way to creating your own visuals.

Many of the steps below are taken from the amazing DaveJ posts. I’ve also added a few steps that I like to do as well. 0. Choose your SD Card size wisely IMPORTANT: Make sure you use an SD card that is smaller than your target SD card or else you won’t be able to copy this image to it later. For example, I’m doing this on an 8GB card for my base image, but will use 32GB cards for instances of this base image. You could use 32GB for both, but you’ll have to figure out how to shrink the image, which just adds time to things and isn’t easy on Windows. 1. Format SD Card using Windows Disk Management This step is optional, but probably a good thing to do so you know you are starting off with a clean SD Card. 2. Flash Raspbian to SD Card using Win32 Disk Imager Download Raspbian Image: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ Download Win32 Disk Imager: https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ Flash Image to SD Card 3. Insert Card in Raspberry Pi and Power On 4. Setup Wifi Click on Wifi icon in top right. Select your network. 5. Install Raspbian Updates 6. Enable Remote Access 6.5 Rename your PI Give it a unique name in Raspberry Pi Config - do this now or you will have issues later. 7. Login to Pi from Windows username: pipassword: raspberry 7. Configuration System: Click Expand Filesystem Change Password Interfaces: Enable All Interfaces Localisation: Set Locale Set Timezone Set Keyboard. Not sure why, but I had to set keyboard on the device itself. The dialog wouldn’t popup over xrdp. I set to US. Set Wifi Country 8. Setup Windows File Share Run to set a file share and password for samba that you will use to connect via Windows. Map Network Drive to \\rpi1\\PiShare Enter Creds Create a directory called “code” to put your code in. 9. Install Node.js 10. Configure npm to run without sudo This moves your npm global node_modules folder to /home/pi/.npm-packages/lib/ and allows you to install packages without using “sudo” Hit enter when it asks you for home directory Type “y” and hit enter when it asks you to update bashrc/zshrc files 11. Install Packages Here are the packages I need at the moment. Yours will be different. Remove/add as you see fit. Ignore any node-gyp issues. 12. Configure Packages The “noble” package doesn’t run without “sudo” by default. Here’s how to configure to allow you to run without sudo. Instructions from here. You don’t need to do this step if you don’t install noble. 13. Create Raspberry Pi Base Image Now that you have all the settings the way you want them, you can use Win32 Disk Imager to write it to disk, so you can use this as a base image for future Raspberry Pis. IMPORTANT: Make sure you use an SD card that is smaller than your target SD card or else you won’t be able to copy this image to it later.

Individual IoT devices will connect to the Gateway via some transport layer (BLE, NFC, etc) and the Gateway will forward the device data to IoT Hub. The Gateway will usually aggregate many messages into a single message or convert it to a data protocol (MQTT, AMQP, etc) that IoT Hub understands. Here’s how to get it the Field Gateway running on a Raspberry Pi 3. Download Raspbian I’m using Raspbian Jessie full desktop image. Get a MicroSD Card and MicroSD USB Card Reader I have a Kingston 32GB Class 10 MicroSD card and a Transcend USB 3.0 Card Reader Install Win32DiskImager This will be used to write Raspbian to the MicroSD card https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ Copy Raspbian to MicroSD card Open Win32DiskImager. Find the yyyy-mm-dd-raspbian-jessie.img file. Select your USB drive. Click Write. This took about 5 minutes on my machine. Get Raspberry Pi Ready Plug in HDMI monitor, keyboard, mouse and Ethernet cable (you can also use Wifi instead) Configure Remote Access to Pi TightVNC allows you to remote desktop into the Raspberry Pi from your Windows desktop. This step is optional. You could also just use the monitor, mouse and keyboard that is connected to the Pi, but that gets old quick. There are other options here, but I’ve found TightVNC to be the most reliable when you just need to connect to the Pi from the same wireless network. If the Pi is on a difference network, then use Weaved. All your remote options are located here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/. Feel free to use one that best suits your needs. SSH with Putty is a good option if you don’t need to access the desktop. Go to Azure IoT Field Gateway SDK GitHub Page If you are using TightVNC, on the Pi, open the web browser and go to http://bit.ly/azuregatewaypi – that will redirect you to this page on your Pi, so you can easily copy and paste the following commands. If you are using SSH, then just execute the commands below in your SSH window. Install Packages sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install curl build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev git cmake libssl-dev uuid-dev valgrind libglib2.0-dev` Clone the Azure IoT Field Gateway Repo You can clone into any directly you want. I usually put everything in a /code folder. git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk.git Checkout the Develop Branch This is the branch that contains a fix that allows the Gateway to be built on the Pi git checkout develop Init Submodules I like to execute this command after I checkout a branch to be sure I have the latest submodule bits that correspond to my current branch. git submodule update --init --recursive Run Build.sh Change to the /tools directory and excute build.sh cd tools./build.sh This will take a while. Come back in 30 mins or so. Test Failures You will likely see these test failures, which are known issues reported on GitHub. The e2e tests fail because we didn’t setup the IoT Hub connection. That’ll be the topic of a different blog post. The following tests FAILED: 27 - constbuffer_unittests (Failed) 34 - httpapiex_unittests (Failed) 41 - sastoken_unittests (Failed) 63 - mqtt_client_unittests (Failed) 77 - iothubclient_http_e2etests (Failed) 79 - iothubclient_mqtt_e2etests (Failed) 81 - iothubclient_amqp_e2etests (Failed) 109 - gw_e2etests (Failed) Errors while running CTest Copy JSON Settings File to Build Folder From the root of the repo run this command to copy the sample JSON settings file to the build output folder. cp ./samples/hello_world/src/hello_world_lin.json ./build/samples/hello_world/hello_world_lin.json` Run Hello_World_Sample Change to the /build folder Run the following command to start the sample. ./samples/hello_world/hello_world_sample ./samples/hello_world/hello_world_lin.json You should now see this output. This sample writes an entry to the /build/log.txt file. If you open that file you will see the entries. From the /build folder just enter “vi log.txt” to view the file. You now have the Azure IoT Gateway Running on a Raspberry Pi 3!

Here are a few tricks that I learned along the way. Re-use Default Fiddler Inspectors For PowerBI-Fiddler, I wanted to re-use the JSONResponseViewer that Fiddler uses for their “JSON” inspector. I used JustDecompile to decompile Fiddler.exe and discovered that the default inspectors are located in this DLL: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Fiddler2\\Inspectors\\Standard.dll. The JSONResponseViewer is sealed, so you have to use a composition pattern instead of inheritance. You can see an example here: https://github.com/jongio/PowerBIFiddler/blob/master/PowerBIFiddler/TileDataViewer.cs Inspector loading Fiddler searches %userprofile%\\Documents\\Fiddler2\\Inspectors and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Fiddler2\\Inspectors for Inspectors when it launches. You’ll want to copy your custom Inspectors into either of those folders. I setup the following Post-build event to automatically copy the DLL over after each build. mkdir \"%userprofile%\\My Documents\\Fiddler2\\Inspectors\\\"copy \"$(TargetPath)\" \"%userprofile%\\My Documents\\Fiddler2\\Inspectors\\$(TargetFilename)\"copy \"Newtonsoft.Json.dll\" \"%userprofile%\\My Documents\\Fiddler2\\Inspectors\\\" Debugging To get F5 debugging, you’ll want to set your Start Action to Fiddler.exe, like this: ** ** Learn by Decompiling Existing Extensions You’ll find a bunch of good examples here: http://www.telerik.com/fiddler/add-ons.

The data pipeline is: IoT Device –&gt; Azure IoT Hub –&gt; Azure Stream Analytics –&gt; Power BI. Follow along with this post if you want to build out a simple version to get your started. Please leave a comment if you have any issues along the way. Here’s the end result…trust me, it updates in real-time once you build this out. Azure IoT Hub will be setup with the new Azure Portal https://portal.azure.com IoT Device Code is on GitHub here https://github.com/jongio/UWPIoTDevice Azure Stream Analytics will be setup with the old Azure Portal https://manage.windowsazure.com (Stream Analytics is in the new portal, but it doesn’t have Power BI output yet) Power BI dashboard will be setup at http://app.powerbi.com Azure IoT Hub Follow my “how to Get Started with Azure IoT Hub and a UWP App” to get the IoT Hub setup and the code that will run on your emulated IoT device. When you setup the IoT Hub, choose the S1 option instead of free if you want to write more than 8k messages a day. After following that post you should have UWP IoT Device &lt;–&gt; Azure IoTHub working. Now, let’s modify the device code to write more than a simple string to the IoT Hub. IoT Device Code This is the code that will run on the emulated IoT Device. It will write random JSON Serialized messages to your IoT Hub. The data model is simple a single “Participant” class with “Position” and “Count” properties. public class Participant&#123; public int Position &#123; get; set; &#125; public int Count &#123; get; set; &#125;&#125; 1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/jongio/UWPIoTDevice 2. Open the DeviceKey.txt file and paste in your device connection string from the Azure Portal. (I don’t do much UWP dev and couldn’t quickly figure out how they want us to store config settings like this, so I just dropped it in a text file. LMK if you know a better way to manage config settings) 3. Compile and move onto next step. Azure Stream Analytics Stream Analytics will take messages from IoT Hub and push them to Power BI. There are three things you need to configure: input, query and output. 1. Go to the old Azure Portal: https://manage.windowsazure.com 2. Create a new Stream Analytics 3. Connect the “input” to the IoT Hub you created earlier. Choose “Data stream”, “IoT Hub”, “JSON” and “UTF8” 4. Connect the “output” to Power BI. You will need to authenticate to Power BI. 5. Write a query that connects your IoT Hub input to your Power BI output. 6. Click the Save button. 7. Start the Stream Analytics job. Power BI Stream Analytics will automatically create the Power BI dataset after you send the first message to it. 1. Open up the UWPIoTDevice project you cloned earlier and send a single message. 2. Go to http://app.powerbi.com. You should see that the Power BI dataset has been automatically created. 3. Click on the dataset, add the position and count fields. You should now see something like this: 4. Go back to the UWP app and send some more messages, then come back to Power BI and click Refresh. You should now see something like this: Modify the appearance however you’d like. I just added data labels to mine 5. Click “Save” in the upper right hand corner and give the report a name: VERY IMPORTANT: Save the report before pinning the visual to the dashboard. 6. Click on the “Pin” icon on that visual and pin it to a dashboard. 7. Open your dashboard 8. Open the UWPIoTDevice app and send some more messages You should now see the dashboard being updated in real-time as you send more messages to it.

Create a new Azure IoT Hub – Free Tier – in Azure Portal http://portal.azure.com Once that is created, grab the “iothubowner” connection string – primary key value. (Click Settings –&gt; Shared Access Policies –&gt; iothubowner) 2. Install the Azure IoT Hub Device Explorer Windows app – you’ll use this to view and send messages that come and go through the IoT Hub. Enter the iothubowner connection string from the last step and click update. 3. In VS2015, create a new UWP app Click OK here: Enable Developer Mode if prompted to do so. 3. Add a connection to your IoT Hub via References –&gt; Add Connected Service Click “Find more services…” at the bottom. Find “Connected Service for Azure IoT Hub” and install it. You should now see “Azure IoT Hub” Sign-in and find your IoT Hub instance you created earlier. Add a new Device. Once you make that connection, you will now see the device in the Device Explorer Management tab and the Azure Portal Devices blade. The Connected Service will add an AzureIoTHub file to your project. It has helper methods for sending and receiving IoT Hub messages. Open up MainPage.xml and drop a button and textblock onto the design surface. Open MainPage.xml.cs and add this code – receive and send messages to the IoT Hub vai the AzureIoTHub helper. public MainPage()&#123; this.InitializeComponent(); Task.Run( async () =&gt; &#123; while (true) &#123; var message = await AzureIoTHub.ReceiveCloudToDeviceMessageAsync(); await CoreApplication.MainView.CoreWindow.Dispatcher.RunAsync(CoreDispatcherPriority.High, () =&gt; &#123; textBlock.Text += Environment.NewLine + message; &#125;); &#125; &#125; );&#125;private void button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)&#123; Task.Run(async () =&gt; &#123; await AzureIoTHub.SendDeviceToCloudMessageAsync(); &#125;);&#125; Compile and Run the VS Project.

I was recently in need of a long running workflow engine and wanted to take advantage of all the async/await goodness. I looked at a bunch of options, including Windows Workflow Foundation, BizTalk, Logic Apps and WorkflowEngine.net. I haven’t gone too deep into DTF, but from the surface it looks like it is lightweight enough and pretty straight forward with minimal dependencies. DTF is on GitHub here: https://github.com/Azure/durabletask It has two main components: Orchestrations and Tasks. Orchestrations “orchestrate” your application logic and executes custom code inline and calls out to Tasks. Your custom orchestrations are derived from TaskOrchestration&lt;TResult, TInput&gt; and your custom tasks are derived from TaskActivity&lt;TInput, TResult&gt; To use it as is today, you should either get a release of it here or if you want to build it locally, I recommend that you sync to my PR here, or just use my fork here, which updates all the NuGet packages to the latest versions and upgrades it to .NET 4.6.1.Once you clone the repo, open up the DurableTaskSamples.sln, build and run unit tests to make sure all is good. Make sure you restore NuGetpackages, right click solution name and click “Restore NuGet Packages” Here’s a quick walkthrough on how to get it setup. Setup Azure Table Storage 1. Go to the new Azure Portal and create a new Storage Account. Click New and then search for “storage account”. Select “Resource Manager” deployment model Give it a name, select pricing model, subscription, resource group and location. Get the connection string from the Settings –&gt; Access Keys blade Copy that connection string to the “StorageConnectionString” appSetting in DurableTaskSamples/App.config Service Bus Go to the Azure Portal and create a new Service Bus Topic, which has to be done at http://manage.windowsazure.com, not http://portal.azure.com Grab the connectionstring for that service bus and paste it into “ServiceBusConnectionSTring” appSetting in DurableTaskSamples/App.config You can also change the taskHubName appSetting if you want to. Run DurableTaskSamples Double click on DurableTaskSamples Properties and change the Debug-&gt;Start Options-&gt;Command line arguments to this: “-c –s Greetings” Set a breakpoint in Program.cs, SendGreetingTaks.Execute and GetUserTask.Execute and hit F5. Step through the code and you should see this: Enter your name and continue to step through the code and you’ll see this. As you can see, for this very simple orchestration “GreetingsOrchestration” there are two called tasks “GetUserTask”, which does the name prompt and “SendGreetingTask”, which writes the greeting to the console. GreetingsOrchestration derives from TaskOrchestration&lt;string, string&gt; and has a RunTask method that calls GetUserTask and SendGreetingTask. GetUserTask derives from TaskActivity&lt;string, string&gt; and implements the Execute method SendGreetingTask derives from TaskActivity&lt;string, string&gt; and implements the Excute method One other thing I noticed is that you can Schedule a task using its namespace like so: That would basically allow you to create data driven workflows that are mapped to TaskActivitys via namespaces. Another thing to note in the above same is the use of “await Task.WhenAny”. This allows you to have conditional forks in your logic. I’m still learning DTF myself, but so far is looks like a lightweight async task executor that might be a great alternative to Workflow Foundation.

That didn’t work, so I took the extruder assembly apart and successfully removed the plastic with the declogger tool. Whatcha do when your hot end is clogged. #3dprinting pic.twitter.com/TTJMGo42kn — Jon Gallant (@jongallant) March 12, 2016 All was good – I was ready to start printing again. But, as I went to put the nozzle back into the heater block I tightened it a little two much and snapped the nozzle into two pieces. Here’s a picture of my broken nozzle. Up until this point I hadn’t really considered the uniqueness of my nozzle, but it turns out that my printer, the Dremel Idea Builder, has an MK10, M7 Thread, .4mm orifice nozzle. It was late on Friday night. I had a ton of printing to do and a deadline to meet. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a spare nozzle on-hand. So… 1. I emailed the Microsoft Garage and my 3D printing friends in IoT Maker. They didn’t have an exact match 2. I called Vetco and Fry’s the next day. Fry’s doesn’t have 3D printer parts and Vetco doesn’t carry my nozzle. 3. I searched online and narrowed it down to either: Proto-Pasta.com or Micro Swiss. I ended up going with Micro Swiss because it was a few dollars cheaper and the description says they coat it with TwinClad XT a nickel composite designed for very low friction. After I ordered it I emailed Micro Swiss asking them to rush the delivery. I just got an email back from them saying they shipped it with priority. It should be here by Wednesday. Lessons learned: 1. Don’t use too much tension when reassembling the nozzle back into the heater block. 2. Have a spare nozzle on hand, just in case you break one. Update: 3/17/2016 I got the Micro Swiss nozzle and it is working great. It was clogged this morning, but I think it was my fault for pausing a print for too long. There all better. The new MicroSwiss nozzle works perfectly. #3dprinting. pic.twitter.com/qbCjzOeMlM — Jon Gallant (@jongallant) March 17, 2016 Jon","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"3D Printing","slug":"Tech/3D-Printing","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/3D-Printing/"}],"tags":[{"name":"3dprinting","slug":"3dprinting","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/3dprinting/"}]},{"title":"How to Setup a Visual Studio Online (VSO) Git Repo in SourceTree","slug":"vso-sourcetree","date":"2016-03-12T06:37:00.000Z","updated":"2016-12-29T03:37:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/03/vso-sourcetree/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2016/03/vso-sourcetree/","excerpt":"","text":"Here’s what you have to do to get a VSO git repo setup in SourceTree Go to VSO Personal Access Tokens: https://{vso-account-name}.visualstudio.com/_details/security/tokens Replace {vso-account-name} with your VSO account name Click “Add” Enter a Description and set your preferences for Expiration, Accounts and Scopes.

Here’s what the bottom of the model looks like: As you can see, that inset text prevents the part from sitting completely on the bed. It will actually print fine, but I would just prefer it sit flush. It won’t have the nice bevel on the top, but that’s okay with me. The first thing you have to to is find out how far inset the text is by using the cross section dialog in Simplify3d You will see below that I moved the Z-Axis to .50mm and I can see through the text. If I bump that up to .51 the text holes are filled in: That means that the text is inset .50mm and I need to start my print at .51mm. I then go into my Process settings –&gt; Advanced Tab and check “Start printing at height:” and set it to .51mm I then click on “Prepare to Print” and slide to the bottom layer.

I will keep this post updated with new tips as I learn more about the machine. A lot of these tips apply to any 3D printer, so it’s worth a read even if you don’t have the Dremel. See my How to Get Started with 3D Printing on a Thousand Dollar Budget post for details on my 3D printing setup. Setup tips 1. Make sure the 3 blue wheels are screwed onto the bottom of the build plate. One of my wheels was off when I unboxed it and I didn’t know what it was for. I left it off when I did my first level and that caused the hot-end to poke a hole into the bed. So, screw on all 3 of the wheels and put the bed in the lowest position before you start to level it. Here’s the quick start guide and a video that shows you how to level it. Here’s another video from Dremel that is good: 2. Make sure the printer is on a stable and level surface. I have mine on a window sill that is very stable. 3. Connect the printer to your computer via USB so you don’t have to keep moving an SD card from your computer to your printer. Printing tips 1. Whenever you switch filaments, make sure you run the LOAD process twice. You want to see the new filament come through the hotend for a couple of seconds before you start your next print. If you don’t do this, then the extruder won’t be primed enough; your next print won’t have enough filament to get started. 2. Clean the bed with rubbing alcohol before each print. This will help the print stick to the bed and will remove any residue from the previous print. Just put a double folded paper towel on the bottle and turn the bottle over once or twice, then wipe the bed with it. Make sure it is dry before you start the print. 3. Not all prints will stick to the bed. Make sure you watch the first couple of layers print before leaving it alone to print the rest of it. If those first couple of layers don’t print then the rest of the print won’t have anything to stick to. 4. Besure to let enough plastic extrude through the hotend when switching plastic. If you don’t then your first print with your new plastic won’t stick to the bed. 5. Print with a skirt to get an early indication if the print is going to be a good one or not. 6. Level your bed before you print, especially on a longer print. 7. Level with a cold hotend (if you can). The distance between your hotend and bed will change based on the hotend temp. 8. Get a thin paint scraper tool to help you remove the print from the bed. I prefer that over printing a raft and then trying to separate the raft from the print. Becareful not to gough the print bed tape. 9. Get some wire cutters to cut the filament and some needle nose plyers to remove support material. 10. When unloading filament don’t pull up too hard. If you are having trouble getting the filament out of the extruder, just push down on the filament, into the extruder, to heat up the end and then pull up. That will melt any rough edges and it should come right out.

It’s a ton of fun and I finally think I got into the groove of things over the last couple of months. I know a lot of you want to get into it as well, but don’t know where to get started. In this post, I’ll bring you through how I got started and where I am today. I started with an UP Plus 2 over a year a go and got some good prints out of it, but I didn’t want to buy one for myself because the accompanying software is really difficult to use and I’ve heard it doesn’t do PLA (a type of plastic) well. I also used the Makerbot Replicator Z18, but that was $6k and I never got a good print out of it. I didn’t go with Printrbot because I wanted something that is plug and play and didn’t require a lot of setup – I spent too many hours trying to configure the Printrbot at work – for home I wanted to get something that just worked out of the box. I considered a lot of printers that I could buy for my home and finally landed on the Dremel Idea Builder for $899 from Home Depot (It looks like it is $999 now). There are cheaper machines like the Printerbot Simple and the Printerbot Play, but the Dremel comes with great support and Home Depot has a 90 return policy – whereas most online places have 15-30 day return policies and 20% restocking fees. Most of the 3D printer makers have email only support; Dremel has phone support and is very responsive. As an example, when I was setting up my Dremel, the hotend (the metal tip where the plastic comes out) poked a hole into my glass print bed. I emailed Dremel support and they replaced the bed without question. What you need to get started You’ll need three things to get started: modeling software, prep software and a printer. 3D Modeling Software – This is the software you’ll use to create your own 3D objects. I recommend Autodesk Fusion 360. It’s a professional parametric modeler that is free to use until you make a profit from using it. I reviewed a bunch of 3D modeling software options in my 7 part blog series and landed on Fusion 360. If you want to start printing now then just go find something at Thingiverse. 3D Printing Prep Software – This is the software that you’ll use to prepare our 3D objects to print. It will allow you to create rafts, supports and tell it things like how many shells (outside layers) and how much infill (inside density) you want. I recommend buying Simplify3D for $150 – the software that comes with your Dremel is not good enough. It doesn’t support generate rafts and is not configurable enough. I tried Meshmixer and Print Studio, but none of them are as good as Simplify3D. I resisted buying it for a month or so because I didn’t want to spend more money, but I now consider it a must. The supports it creates are amazing and EVERYTHING is configurable. 3D Printer – I recommend the Dremel Ideal Builder for all the reasons I mention above. It’s a great, simple printer that is easy to use and has a decent size print bed. There are less expensive printers out there. I would encourage you to find one that Simplify3D supports. You could also go with the Flashforge Dreamer – which has more features than the Dremel, but doesn’t come with the same level of support and returnability. My 3D Workflow **1. Design my object in **Autodesk Fusion 360 or download one from Thingiverse.com or GrabCAD.com **2. Prep my object for printing in **Simplify3D ** ** [ 3. Print my object with the Dremel Idea Builder This should be a good enough post to get your started. I’ll post more as I learn more.

I immediately thought that would be something cool to render with Fusion. If you haven’t seen it yet, Fusion has an amazing rendering engine, especially for glass, metal and wood. It took me a number of iterations and a bunch of back and forth with Taylor Stein (from Fusion 360 team), but I was finally able to create this with Fusion: It’s not an exact match to the original - but it’s definitely close enough for me.

I started with the red/blue side of the logo as my main face. You can see it bends up first and then bends down. I’ve been learning the subtractive 3D modeling technique which basically says you start with primitives like rectangles and squares and then carve out the shapes you want. You can see above that I first created a rectangle of construction lines and then drew the wave using the anchors. The rectangle acts as a guide for the lines that make up the wave. Here are the construction lines. It’s a rectangle that 40mm x 4mm on the perimeter and then two lines through the middle, one at 10mm and the other at 30mm. Those lines allow the wave to have consistent touch points throughout. Here’s the first spline based on those construction lines I then created 4 more construction lines for the height of the side. It’s a little hard to tell from this screenshot, but look at the 4.00 lines that are selected. Make the 3 lines in the middle “construction lines” so they don’t interfere with the overall sketch of the wave. If you keep them as normal lines then they will subdivide the sketch. As construction lines, they are just there to help you form your shape. Draw another spline along those new lines. We now have our first side. We’ll copy that sketch to a new plane and then use the Sweep command to create the solid shape. Click Stop Sketch and then Start a new Sketch by selecting one of the sketch tools. (If it doesn’t immediately create a new sketch for you, then toggle back and forth between stop sketch, select and the drawing tool until you get this: Select the plane that is perpendicular to your first sketch. Drag and hold your mouse to select the entire first sketch Then hit Ctrl+C to copy it. Deselect the sketch by clicking anywhere on the empty grid. Then hit Ctrl+V to paste it into your new sketch. You will then see this: (If you don’t, keep trying by making sure nothing is selected when you hit Ctrl+V) Now we need to execute the Sweep command of the first sketch along the path of the one we just copied. Under the Create menu, select Sweep That will bring up the Sweep dialog. Select the first sketch as the Profile and the bottom line of the second sketch as the Path. Also, select “Parallel” from Orientation (that will draw the shape lines straight up and down versus slanted with the other options. That is your overall main shape. Now we need to cut it in 4 pieces using the Split Body command. First create two new “Midplanes” to slice on. Choose Midplane under the construct menu The first one: Both of them: Now choose “Split Body” under the Modify menu. Select the body and then one of the Midplanes as the Splitting tool. Do the same thing for the other plane. You then have your shape cut in 4 pieces I used the “Move” tool to space them out by 10mm. Then I applied a Fillet of .2 So, here’s the final shape before we start rendering it as glass. Now let’s render it. Choose Render under the leftmost menu Select the Appearance button that looks like a color wheel. That will bring up the Appearance dialog Drag the red, green, blue to the corresponding body parts For yellow, just drag Glass (Clear) and then change the color to yellow Modify each of the colors as below: You will now have this: Don’t worry, it looks bad now because we haven’t rendered it yet. Click on Enable Ray Tracing to get a preview Click “Scene Settings” to adjust the type and position of the reflection. For position, you can adjust as you like, but mine is something like this: Here are the rest of the settings So already it looks pretty awesome But, the magic happens on the cloud rendering. Save your work. Select “Cloud Rendering” Here are the settings I typically use when I want a final render. You should see your rendering queue at the bottom of the screen You can also view your renders here: https://rendering.360.autodesk.com/mygallery.aspx Here’s the final rendered version. I hope you learned a little more about Fusion 360 by following along. It was a great learning experience for me.

My goal is to suck in all the data from those sources, pop it into a database and then create a Power BI dashboard out of it. To do so, I created a webhook endpoint that accepts HTTP POST operations so I can have a single endpoint that accepts data and inserts it into the database. The missing part was querying for the data and calling my webhook. Instead of writing all those connectors I would rather use a service that does that for me. There are a bunch of services out there that enable service to service integrations, like Zapier and IFTTT. There’s a good list of them here. I spent a bunch of time with Zapier because they have connectors to most of the services I need to connect with and they support webhooks. IFTTT does those things as well, but I found their product to be too buggy for me to work with, especially the webhook (aka Maker) connector. Zapier is a polished product with an amazing user experience, but there are a few limitations that I think you should know about. I want to make sure you know that I think very highly of Zapier as a product. The UX is amazing. The error messaging is great. The support team is phenomenal. There are just two important things that prevent me from using it…. It only retrieves new data Zapier is for “new” data. Any new piece of content that is created in your source connector will be sent to your destination connector. But, if you need old data you have to get that yourself. It doesn’t allow you to go back in time. For my project, I have to get old and new data from the source. I could still use Zapier for new data, but I would have to write a script to get old data to prime it. If I go that far to get old data, then I can just quickly write a script to ping for new data. So, that alone would prevent me from using Zapier. I asked Zapier if they plan to expose direct access to their connectors so I could use then when creating my code to get old data. They unfortunately said no. My suggestion to Zapier is to allow for historical data retrieval or give us access to the connectors so we can prime with old data and then continue to use Zaps for new data. It can get costly Zapier has “Zaps” and “Tasks”. A Zap is equivalent to a job that connects source and destination data and a Task is equivalent to a POST operation to your destination. They charge per Task, not per run of the Zap. Tasks can add up quickly, especially if you have a lot of connectors that are popular. I incorrectly assumed that a Task was a “run of the Zap”, but it’s not. A Task is “an execution of your destination connector”. If your destination is a webhook, then each time they call that webhook will count as a Task. As you can see on their pricing page you have multiple plans to choose from. ![](/images/blog/zapier1.png) They also have \"[higher plans](https://zapier.com/help/higher-plans/)\" ![](/images/blog/zapier2.png) Imagine if your Zap is setup to watch Twitter for #adele25 and POSTs those Tweets to your webhook endpoint. When Zapier runs the Zap it will query Twitter for that hashtag and then it will call your webhook for each Tweet it returns. That one Zap would eat up your Tasks in minutes. In my case, Twitter is only one of 20+ connectors that I need to setup. Even at the Enterprise plan at $400/month or $4,800 a year the Task allocation of 200,000 a month wouldn’t be enough. **My suggestion to Zapier would be to charge per run of a Zap, not per Task. ** I want to stress that Zapier is a great product – but from my view it has a flawed billing model. It might be perfect for you, if you 1) only need new data 2) are** okay with their pricing model**. Just make sure you understand that a Task is per Tweet, not per run of the Zap. Hope this helps.

Here are some of my previous blog posts to give you an idea of how I operate: My Thoughts on Work/Life Balance at Microsoft My Thoughts on Developer Productivity My Thoughts on the Microsoft Career Model My Thoughts on the Microsoft Employee Review Model History This is my 11th year at Microsoft and I’ve been fortunate enough to work on a lot of different teams including Bing, MSN, Ads, Windows and MSDN. I spent the last year in a really fun role over on the Windows IoT Maker team. I helped them ship Windows 10 IoT Core by improving their CRM system for the Raspberry PI 2 release; fostered the collaboration with Hackster.io to host our projects and help bootstrap our community; I implemented the Maker GitHub pages site; I learned 3D modeling and printing; I met a whole new crowd of developers called “Makers” and developed a passion around combining hardware with software to build end-to-end products. Power BIWhile it was fun and I learned a ton, I heard about an opportunity over in Power BI that I couldn’t pass up. Power BI is Microsoft’s new business intelligence product that is built on top of all of the previous generations of BI products like SSAS, SSRS, Power Query, Power Pivot and Power View. It is a data visualization platform on the surface via the Power BI website, but there is so much more under the covers that we like to call “data exploration”, which involves the entire spectrum of analyzing big data in the cloud. When I started talking with the Power BI team they were getting ready to release PowerBI.com to the world and were laying plans for the future. Part of that future included a big push to add robust developer experiences that enable any developer to integrate with Power BI via REST APIs, embed Power BI visuals into their applications and extend Power BI by creating custom charts and graphs. (Power BI Dashboard)DecisionsI have many years of experience and passion for building developer platforms and dev teams, so I had to pursue it further. I spent many hours talking with folks in Power BI and many more hours laboring over one of the most important decisions of my career. Should I stay on the Maker team and develop my Windows and Hardware muscle or do I join Power BI and get back into my wheelhouse of building services, building dev teams and developing consumer facing products? Towards the end of my decision making process it became clear that moving to Power BI was the right move. This opportunity presented itself directly in the space that I had invested so much of myself in. I still have a passion for “making” and am actually still teaching classes at the Microsoft Garage – but my full time job will now be Engineering Manager for the Power BI Developer Experiences team.HiringWith that, the first thing I need to do is build a new dev team. I’m mainly looking for Senior and Principal developers with 7+ years of experience, but I have opened positions at all levels because I want to be open to less-experienced star developers. I personally wrote the job description below; read it and let me know if it describes you. The rest of Power BI is also hiring, so I’m including a few of those job descriptions below as well. Feel free to submit your resume to the one that you connect with the most.How to Apply Find the job below that best matches your skills and experience Click the “Apply Now” link next to the job title to officially apply to Microsoft at Microsoft.com **Important: Use this form to email your resume to me with quick blurb about why you’d be a good fit. ** Job Description Click on the role that best matches your years of hands-on experience to apply. SDE (2-3 years) – Apply Now SDE II (4-6 years) – Apply Now Senior (7-10 years) – Apply Now Principal (10+ years) – Apply Now Power BI is the future of data exploration. Microsoft is investing a tremendous amount of resources into Power BI with a singular objective: allow our users to visualize their most critical business data so they can make real-time decisions. We just shipped our first major offering last month and our initial usage numbers are astounding (we can share more details in-person). Microsoft expects hockey stick growth with Power BI, but that is almost entirely dependent on us building a beautiful developer experience that allows businesses to push their data directly into Power BI and customize their data exploration experience.Our customers love what we have done so far and their big asks are to make the entire product available programmatically via an API; be able to embed Power BI tiles, reports and dashboards in their applications and make content creation simple…so that is what we are going to do. With our expected growth in mind, we decided to make these scenarios a top priority and created a new team focused on it. This is where you come in. We need you to come help design and implement modern standards-based web applications, REST APIs and complementing language specific SDKs that allow developers to create custom HTML5 visualization controls, perform data operations, see real-time data feeds and much more. We are going full bore on our developer ecosystem efforts to give any customer the ability to easily embed, extend and integrate our visuals into the Power BI dashboard and their own applications. We got a good start on this effort with a bare-bones API and we put our Visuals on GitHub. Now we want to take it to the next level and tell a complete end-to-end story that allows our clients to extend Power BI to meet their business’s needs. We LOVE open source and in fact our product is built with AngularJS and D3.js. Giving back to the open source community is super important to us and our team is going to drive that effort to create a real community of people that are passionate about data exploration.That’s us. Here’s how we’d describe the perfect you…You have a passion for an amazing developer experience.

Very simply, it’s a hardware device that will change color to Red, Yellow or Green as your Skype for Business status changes. You can put it in your home or office to let people know when you are busy, free or away. beakn has been through many iterations and I ultimately decided to use the Spark Core as my microcontroller development board because it comes with WiFi, has cloud events and is relatively cheap. Since my last post, Microsoft renamed Lync to Skype for Business, Spark changed its name to Particle and they released a new board called the Photon. It has all the capabilities as the Core and it’s only $20. This post is a very quick walkthrough on how to setup the simplest version of beakn. All of the source is MIT. Forks make me happy, so please, fork on and be creative with it. Setup Photon You will want to get your Photon setup with WiFi and associated with your Particle account. I have instructions for doing so with either PuTTY or Node.js. Please select the method you prefer. I recommend the Node.js route if you are comfortable with Node.js “How to Setup a Particle Photon with Windows and PuTTY” “How to Setup a Particle Photon with Node.js” Go to one of those posts, follow all of the instructions and then come back here to continue setting up your status light. Flash beakn to Photon Particle makes it really easy for you to share your scripts with others via their Community Libraries feature. I added beakn to the library…here’s how to get it installed. 1. Go to Particle Build (the cloud IDE) 2. Make sure the device you want to work with has the star next to it in the Device tab. In my case I want to flash to photon25. 3. Click on the “Libraries” icon in the lower left rail 4. Seach for “beakn” and click on the beakn project. You will see the code load to the right. It’s very simple. Just exposes a method that the beakn Desktop app calls when your Skype for Business status changes. That method sets the on-board RGB led based on what status is sent to it. You can also find this code on GitHub here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jongio/beakn-sparkcore/master/firmware/examples/beakn-sparkcore-onboard-led.ino 5. Click the “USE THIS EXAMPLE” button. 6. Click the “Flash” icon in the upper left rail You will then see a couple of messages in the footer while it is being flashed Your Photon will reboot after it is done flashing and the Led will very likely turn off. That’s okay, just move onto the next step. Install Skype for Business Make sure you have Skype for Business installed and you are signed in. The beakn desktop application will use the Skype library events to notify the Particle cloud that there’s a change. Install beakn Desktop Application The beakn Desktop application listens for Skype for Business status change events and sends those to your Photon. All the code for this app is MIT and is located here. Feel free to fork it and be creative. Go to the beakn releases GitHub page and install the latest version via the msi file: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases 2. When you launch beakn for the first time it should see that you haven’t entered your Photon Id or Access Token and prompt you to do so. If it doesn’t then just go the place where you installed it and click on the beakn.exe file, then click on the Settings button. The Settings dialog will look like this: 3. Enter your Photon Id and Access Token that you copied over into Notepad when you setup your Photon. If you don’t have them, then scroll to the top of this page and follow the “Setup Photon” link. As soon as you click Ok beakn will get your Skype for Business status and update your Photon LED color. Congrats! You now have a very basic Skype for Business status light up and running!! Switch Your Status Open up Skype for Business and toggle your status and watch the Photon light change! Next Now that you have beakn running it’s time for you to experiment. Wire up some brighter LEDs. Add a battery and a on/off toggle switch. Mount it on Groot. Build a custom enclosure. Be creative with it. Make on!

Particle has some slick iOS and Android apps to help you connect your Photons to Wifi and associate them with your account. But they unfortunately don’t have a Windows Phone version yet. I’ve been working with them a lot lately and doing sessions at the Microsoft Garage. Not surprisingly, a lot of those folks do not have iPhones or Android devices – so they have to use either the Serial or the Node.js particle-cli method to setup their Photons. I normally prefer Node.js, but I found Serial with PuTTY to be easy enough and more familiar to devs that aren’t versed in Node.js and npm. Install PuTTY We will be using PuTTY (a Telnet/SSH client) to connect to the Photon to setup WiFi and get the Photon Id. 1. Go to the PuTTY download page and download the putty.exe file. I personally put utilities like this in c:\\utils and then add c:\\utils to my PATH environment variables. That way I don’t have to edit my PATH every time I download a new utility. The direct link to the putty file I used is: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe Put Photon in Listening Mode We need to get the Photon in Listening mode (flashing blue) to configure it. (You can learn about the other Photon modes here) 1. Plug Photon into your computer’s USB port. 2. Is your Photon flashing blue? If so, move on to next step. If not, then hold down the Setup button until the LED flashes blue. If you can’t get it to flash blue then hit the Reset key and try again. Connect to Photon 1. Open Device Manager and find your Photon under Ports (COM &amp; LPT). Make note of the COM port it is assigned to. In my case it is COM4. 2. Open PuTTY a) Select the Serial radio button b) Enter COM4 (or whatever port your Photon is assign to) into the **Serial line **text box c) Keep Speed at 9600 d) Click Open 3. You should now see what looks like Command Prompt. This is the Serial monitor session and looks like this: Get Photon Id We will need to the Photon Id later when we connect it to your Particle Account. 1. From within the PuTTY session, hit the “i” key on your keyboard – this will print your Photon Id. Copy it over into Notepad. You will need it later. Setup Photon WiFi 1. From within the PuTTY session, hit the “w” key on your keyboard – this will initiate the WiFi setup process. 2. Enter your SSID 3. Select your Security Type 4. Enter your Password Your Photon should reboot and will be in Connected mode (Pulsing cyan aka breathing cyan) At this point you should have: a) Photon Id in Notepad b) Photon is connected to WiFi c) Photon is in Connected Mode (breathing cyan) If you do not have those three things, then scroll back up and find out what you missed. Create a Particle Account Now that your Photon is configured let’s create a Particle account and associate the Photon with your account. 1. Create a new Particle Account here or use one that you already have. Add Photon to Particle Account 1. Go to Particle Build (the online cloud IDE) 2. Click on the “Devices” icon in the lower left rail. It looks like a target. 3. Click the “ADD NEW DEVICE” button and copy your Photon Id from Notepad into the box and click the “CLAIM A DEVICE” button. 4. Give the device a name that makes sense to you and click “SAVE” You will now see the device in your “Other” list If you want to deploy to the device right away, then click the star to the left of it to set it to the device to flash to (You can flash one at a time through the cloud IDE). Once you do that you’ll see your device in the Photons list like this: Get Particle Access Token All of the APIs and apps that use your Photon will require an Access Token. You’ll want to copy this over to Notepad so you can use it later. 1. Go to Particle Build (the online cloud IDE) 2. Click on the Settings icon in the lower left rail 3. Copy the Access Token over to Notepad. You will need it later when you call APIs that require it. Next That’s how you get your Photon setup with Windows using PuTTY. From here, you can deploy your own app to your Photon or try building my “Skype for Business Status Light” Make on!

It should have take a few minutes to write the entire job, but the error message led me down a path and I put my blinders onto visibility issues. Based on the message, I spent a bunch of time researching Azure WebJobs attributes to no avail. I then broke the problem down by creating a new WebJob with only a few lines of code: and I still got the issue. So I then did a line-by-line diff of a WebJob that was working and discovered that, by default, the WebJob VS template does not make the class public.

It allows you to easily pull data from datasources like Salesforce, GitHub and QuickBooks. As I was going through the product I noticed they didn’t have a StackOverflow service connection, so I built one. StackOverflow has a REST/JSON API, but Power BI doesn’t allow you to connect directly to an API yet. Instead of hitting the API directly, I wrote an Azure Web Job to pull the data from the StackOverflow API into an Azure SQL Database and then built the Power BI dashboard from that. A StackOverflow dashboard is useful for teams who want to monitor and improve their community engagement. The dashboard will be a quick and easy way for teams to see how many questions are unanswered, how many have no responses, how long it takes to get a response, number of question views over time and number of questions created over time. There’s a lot more insights you could pull from the StackOverflow data, but for now we’ll start with these metrics: 1. Number of Unanswered Questions – These questions may have responses, but none of them are marked as “Answered”. 2. Number of Responseless Questions – These questions have no responses at all. 3. Time to First Response – The time difference between the creation of the question and the first response. 4. Number of Question Views Over Time – The number of views per month. 5. Number of Questions Created Over Time – The number of questions created per month. [ Here’s a list of the components you’ll need to build this out yourself. 1. StackOverflow API – The StackOverflow endpoint that allows you to programmatically access question data. 2. Azure SQL Database – Where you will store the StackOverflow questions relevant to your Power BI Dashboard. 3. Azure WebJob (Node.js or C#) – The “console app in the cloud” that will pull data from the StackOverflow API and push it to an Azure SQL Database 4. Power BI – You will use DataSets and Reports to create your Dashboard. All of the code for this post can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/jongio/PowerBI-StackOverflow StackOverflow API StackOverflow has a robust API at http://api.stackexchange.com. You’ll want to use V2.2. Here’s an example URL: https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?order=desc&amp;sort=creation&amp;tagged=powerbi&amp;site=stackoverflow. That returns a JSON that looks like this: Use a filter The query above will return questions that are tagged with ‘powerbi’ – but it doesn’t contain the ‘answer’ data, which you will need for your Power BI Dashboard. StackOverflow allows you to create ‘filters’ to add that additional data. You can use the one I created** ‘!9YdnSIN1B’** or create your own here: http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/create-filter Here’s the same URL as above, but with the filter applied: https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?order=desc&amp;sort=creation&amp;tagged=powerbi&amp;site=stackoverflow&amp;filter=!9YdnSIN1B You’ll notice that it now has answer data: [ Register your app By default, StackOverflow will limit your requests to 300 a day, but will up that to 10k a day if you register your application and send a key with each request. Register your application to get a key http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register. Save your key, you will need it when you setup your Azure WebJob. Here’s the same URL as above, but with the key applied: https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?order=desc&amp;sort=creation&amp;tagged=powerbi&amp;site=stackoverflow&amp;filter=!9YdnSIN1B&amp;key=undefined (It’s not hyperlinked, because I don’t want my apps key to be on the internet in plain text) Azure SQL Database As mentioned above, Power BI cannot talk directly to the StackOverflow API, so we need to cache the data in an Azure SQL Database. (You, of course, can use any database you’d like, but I prefer to use Azure SQL Database). Just create a new database and execute the following scripts to create one table, one proc and two views. questions table questions_upsert proc questions_answers_dates view questions_by_month view Azure Node.js WebJob An Azure WebJob is like a console app running on a scheduled task in the cloud. You can write them in C# or Node.js. I’ll use Node.js for this example. You can find the WebJob code on GitHub here. The WebJob process flow is simple; it will request the question data via the StackOverflow API and insert it into the database. Create the WebJob WebJobs are housed within Webapps, so just create a Webapp and click on the WebJob tab: Create a new WebJob and upload this zip file. I set mine to run once an hour – feel free to configure your schedule as you wish. You can also fork the PowerBI-StackOverflow repo and update the code as you wish. I’ve found that using an FTP client to upload WebJob is much easier than using the Azure web interface. If you use FTP, then just upload the code to this folder: /site/wwwroot/App_Data/jobs/triggered/pbisof Config The WebJob uses appSettings from the Webapp. Documentation for all of the variables can be found in the header of the run.js file. You can configure them using the Web app Config tab in Azure: When you run the Node.js script locally you will want to create an .env file in the WebJob folder that looks like this and enter the values applicable to your database and your StackOverflow key. Power BI We are going to create a Dashboard with the following visualizations: 1. Number of Unanswered Questions – These questions may have responses, but none of them are marked as “Answered”. 2. Number of Responseless Questions – These questions have no responses at all. 3. Time to First Response – The time difference between the creation of the question and the first response. 4. Number of Question Views Over Time – The number of views per month. 5. Number of Questions Created Over Time – The number of questions created per month. In Power BI you have 3 things to be concerned about: 1. Datasets – The data that you are working with 2. Reports – The raw visualizations on top of your dataset 3. Dashboards – The organized reports that you will share with others. Get Data The first thing you need to do is setup a dataset in Power BI 1. Go to http://app.powerbi.com 2. Click Get Data 3. Select Databases, then Select Azure SQL Database and Click Connect 4. Enter your Azure SQL database connection info: Power BI will connect to your database and import the data into a new dataset, which you can find in the left rail. Create Reports REPORT: Number of Unanswered Questions Over in the left rail, click on the dataset, mine is called pbisof. Then, over in the right rail click on Fields, then questions. For this report we need to do 4 things: 1. Select our fields. We want is_answered and question_id 2. Set our field functions. We want the Count of question_id, not the sum 3. Filter by field value. We want to filter by is_answered = false 4. Select our visualization. For a count like this, the “card” visualization makes the most sense Here’s what you’ll now see in the report draft view. Click Save and name your report You will now see it in your Reports list When you hover over the card you’ll see a pin, click that to add it to a Dashboard. (Make sure you create a Dashboard before clicking that pin) When you hover over the card you’ll see a pencil icon. Click that to edit the card title. REPORT: Number of Responseless Questions This visualization needs to show the number of questions that have no response at all. REPORT: Time to First Response REPORT: Number of Questions Created Over Time REPORT: Number of Question Views Over Time Add all of those reports to your Dashboard and you’ll now have a Dashboard that looks something like this: [ Here’s the same view in the Power BI iPhone app. [ Jon","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tech/Tutorials","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Tutorials/"}],"tags":[{"name":"azure","slug":"azure","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/azure/"},{"name":"dev","slug":"dev","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/dev/"},{"name":"powerbi","slug":"powerbi","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/powerbi/"},{"name":"sql","slug":"sql","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/sql/"},{"name":"nodejs","slug":"nodejs","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/nodejs/"}]},{"title":"How I Gained 30 Pounds in a Year","slug":"how-i-gained-30-pounds-in-year","date":"2015-04-01T14:36:00.000Z","updated":"2018-01-13T15:54:08.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/04/how-i-gained-30-pounds-in-year/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2015/04/how-i-gained-30-pounds-in-year/","excerpt":"","text":"This has been an amazing year. About a year ago, I decided to quit Microsoft and join Starbucks as a Barista Manager in Issaquah. A lot has happened over the last year, but the most important thing is my renewed commitment to my health. I’ve always been on the border between a L and XL and this year I finally decided to make a commitment to XL. In doing so, I came to the conclusion that I would need to gain some weight - at least 30 pounds - a huge challenge, but I was up for it! So, one year ago today I made the commitment to gain 30 pounds and I’m proud to say that as of a week ago I reached that mark. A year ago today I weighed 160…now…wait for it!..I’m a whopping 190 pounds. I’m super excited to have met this goal and so thankful to my friends and family (especially my wife) for their continued support over the last year. It’s been life changing - new daily habits, new food, new clothes, new car, new doorways - all very thrilling. Here’s how I went about turning my life around: Exercise: Before I used to walk at least 10k steps a day. I had a FitBit and I would obsess over that number. Now I move very little. I work from home a lot - often right from my bed. I also used to take afternoon walks - cut those out as well. I now have a hard time making it up a flight of stairs without taking a break - but that’s okay - because I rarely use the stairs. Food: Before I use to eat fresh fruit and nuts for snacks. Now I stack up on bars, candy and chips. I also used to stay away from fried foods and burgers - now that’s all I eat. I actually have this fun game I play where I will ONLY eat fried foods for a month. Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner - All fried. Fried Eggs, French Fries, Chicken Katsu and Fried Chicken Wings. Before this change, I used to drink a few beers at night - now I try to finish off at least a 6 pack before crashing for the night. Usually followed by some late night snacks - with lots of carbs. Huge changes - lots of sacrifices - but worth it! I know this diet won’t work for everyone, but it worked for me. Obviously, consult your doctor before taking on something like this. A huge thanks to everyone who cheered me on over the last year! Here’s to 30 more!

I've been wanting to do all of them for a while…that tweet pushed me to start investigating the Lync REST endpoint for cloud registration and inductive charging is probably a v2 feature, but #2 \"get status on reset\" is totally doable – so I just implemented it and released beakn [v0.4.2](https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/tag/v0.4.2). Here’s what is new in v0.4.2 beakn.exe now listens for the Spark “reset” event and sets the light to the current color. Before this you would have to toggle your status. Now it just works after your Spark is reset. For this change I used EventSource4Net and modified my fork of SharpSpark. I moved Spark Device Id and Access Token from beakn.exe.config to Properties.Settings and added a simple two textbox UI.

Lots of people have been building the beakn and I did a hackathon class last week, so I thought it would be ideal to have a very simple step-by-step walk through. I’m working on getting the beakn officially manufactured so there are more complex versions available if you are comfortable with soldering. The version below is a great starting point. 1: Get a Spark Core or Photon from https://store.spark.io/ [ 2: Plug Spark Core into your computer via USB 3: Install Spark Core iPhone or Android app. If you don’t have an iPhone or Android you will need to follow the “Connect over USB” section of the Spark Getting started guide [ 4: Connect phone to Wifi network Must be WPA2 (SSID and Passcode) – WPA2-Enterprise won’t work. [ 5: Create or Login to Spark Account and connect to same wifi network [ [ 6: Connect Core a) Click on the icon in the upper left and then click “Connect a Core”. You will likely need to sign-in to wifi again. b) Give your Core a name and hit ok. [ 7: Flash beakn code to Spark a) Go to Spark Build (https://www.spark.io/build) b) Click on Libraries in lower left rail c) Search for and click on “beakn” You will see the beakn-sparkcore-onboard-led.ino file to the right d) Click on “USE THIS EXAMPLE” button in the left rail You will then see this page that shows the current app that loaded e) Click on the “Flash” lightning bolt icon in the left rail to send the code to the Spark Code You will see the Spark Core led flash while it is being flashed. If you don’t then use the Spark Core debug help. 8: Install beakn Windows App from http://bit.ly/beakn-client The beakn.exe app listens for Lync events and calls the beakn.setStatus function that you just deployed to the Core. Install the latest version of beakn-{version}.msi from http://bit.ly/beakn-client - which was beakn.v0.4.2 as of this post. The last page of the install will look like this – you will want to keep that “Launch beakn” checkbox checked. 9: Set your Spark settings When beakn.exe launches it checks for your Spark Device Id and Access token and if either are not set you will see this: Click OK and you will see the settings dialog: Go to http://spark.io/build to find both Device Id and Access token and copy and paste them into this settings dialog. To get the Device Id, click on the icon that looks like a target, second from bottom To get the Access Token, click on the icon that looks like gears (standard settings icon) Copy and paste both of those into the beakn settings dialog and then click Ok. You will now see the beakn dialog that is really just a log of the messages that are being sent to your beakn device. 10: Open Lync and Toggle your status to try it out (It’s hard to tell in the photo, but the onboard led changed to red) You should now be all setup with your beakn.

I started 3D printing back in November of last year and started with SketchUp which doesn’t do rounded corners well, then 123D Design which doesn’t allow you precisely adjust sketches after they are drawn. At that point I decided to go deep into some popular and free options to see what else is out there and hopefully provide a good recommendation for makers. Here’s what we have looked at so far: Part 1: SketchUp and 123D Design Part 2: Tinkercad Part 3: Blender Part 4: FreeCad Part 5: DesignSpark Mechanical Part 6: 3dtin.com As of yesterday I finally think I found that best of all worlds with Autodesk Fusion 360. I really liked the UX of 123D Design and Tinkercad, which are also from Autodesk, so Fusion 360 just felt right and natural to me. When I started this exercise I wanted to find something inexpensive, precise, intuitive and inspiring. Fusion 360, by far, meets all of those needs. Their licensing policy is pretty flexible and I think it’s fair. You can use the product if you aren’t making money. As soon as you are profitable they want you to buy a subscription. That is an amazing gesture – a perfect scenario for the maker in my opinion. Yes, you will eventually have to pay, but given my hands-on experience with it, I think it is worth it. ProgramPriceProsCons Autodesk Fusion 360 Free for non-commercial use Fusion 360: $40/month Fusion 360 Ultimate: $150/month Difference between Regular and Ultimate They will let you use it until you make a profit. Intuitive interface. Great community and support. Precise Beautiful rendering Tons of how-to videos on YouTube Internet connection is required to create a new project. Is a little sluggish on my machine, but that might be because I’m running a pre-release version of Windows 10 With each of the options I looked at I started with a simple ring design. It should be as simple as drawing a cylinder, cutting a hole in the middle and round the corners. I also need to be able to go back to the ring and change the dimensions. This only took a few minutes with Fusion 360. Here’s the sketch: And here’s it awesomely rendered by their renderer. This blew me away. I then tried to create a funnel design that I have been having such a hard time creating with the other options. Granted I keep learning as I go through each software option, so at this stage I know more than I did when I was using the other options….but the Fusion 360 experience was amazing Here’s the sketch: And here’s the rendered version: Wow! Beautiful! I then took a stab at the Lego Chi piece. Here’s the sketch: And here are a couple of variations of the render: As you can see Fusion 360 is a big step up in quality and experience from all the other options I’ve looked at. It’s not perfect, but it is the first one that I felt like I should focus on and go deep. I’m still open to other options and will have a look if you make a suggestion. For now, I’m going to go deep with Fusion and see how far I can take it. There’s so much goodness coming out of Autodesk and Fusion 360 that I feel like it is the right choice. I hope this series helps you narrow down your options. Feel free to comment and let me know if you have other favorites that I should look into.

I think it’s only “whole object selection” This is a short one, but given that I couldn’t figure out how to do those simple operations and I don’t see “loft”, “combine”, “sweep”, etc I decided to move onto the next option. 3D Modeling Software Comparison Two WordsInexpensiveUser-FriendlyPreciseInspiringFeature Rich 3dtin Beautiful.

Joe Shirey tweeted his version of beakn which uses the onboard led – I was super happy to see someone build a beakn that I had to share details on how he did it. (Keep in mind that this approach won’t be as bright as the LED array approached used in the previous versions – but it’s a really quick and simple build) Here’s a photo of Joe’s version: [ Here’s how to build your own beakn using the onboard led. 1. Buy a Spark Core or Photon 2. Buy a 4xAA Battery Holder. Either get one like this with the connectors built in, or get some female jumper wires and solder to the battery holder wires to connect to the Spark. 3. Buy a Ping Pong Ball 4. Cut a hole in the top of the box. Cut off the bottom of the ping pong ball. Tape the ball to the cardboard box. See v0.4 post for step-by-step instructions on building the box. 5. Setup the Spark Core via the iOS or Android app. Go to the Spark Core Cloud IDE and copy your deviceId and access token to notepad. 6. Connect Battery to Spark Core. You can also add a power switch like I did in v0.4 7. Tape the Spark Core to the bottom of the box top. 8. Flash the following code to the Spark via the Cloud IDE. 9. Install the beakn Windows application. It’s an app that runs in the background and calls the Spark Core function setStatus when your Lync status changes. To install the desktop app you can:1. Get the source, build it and run it: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/tree/master/desktop2. Install via the v0.4 MSI: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/download/v0.4/beakn.v0.4.msiAfter you install it you are going to need to modify the config to use your Spark Core keys.1. If beakn.exe is running you’ll need to stop it.2. Open notepad as Admin open beakn.exe.config3. Change the Protocol setting to “SparkCore&quot;4. Change the AccessToken and DeviceId to the IDs you get from Spark.io &lt;add key=“SparkCoreAccessToken” value=”&quot;/&gt; // http://spark.io – click on settings in lower left &lt;add key=“SparkCoreDeviceId” value=&quot;&quot;/&gt; // http://spark.io – click on cores in lower left, select your core5. Save it.6. Double-click on beakn.exe to restart it. Congrats! Your beakn with onboard led should now be working.

As I went about searching for the perfect 3D modeling software I figured I would blog about it so you can learn from my experience and reduce the time it takes for you to find one that meets your needs. There are so many 3D modeling software options out there – tons are paid and some are free. My focus is on the maker – someone whose goal is to produce a physical object that can be 3D printed. A maker can be anyone – and I think that a maker, by nature, is a DIY type person – and that type of person would rather build something themselves rather than buy it - even if that means paying more for it in the end. That said, I think the maker would rather not spend money on tools like 3D modeling software. Yes, I could shell out a couple of hundred bucks and find a something perfect. But, I’m thinking from the perspective of the young maker who wants to build something but doesn’t want to spend that kind of money in the early stages of ramping up on everything. We have looked at the following options so far in this series: Part 1: SketchUp and 123D Design Part 2: Tinkercad Part 3: Blender Part 4: FreeCad And this post will focus on DesignSpark Mechanical ProgramPriceProsCons DesignSpark Mechanical Free Familiar interface. Ribbon, properties pane, etc. Better UX than other options Activation issues caused about a 1 day delay. No loft – can’t easily make an object out of two separate outlines. DesignSpark Mechanical is a direct modeling tool as opposed to a parametric one. Basically direct modeling means that you work directly with the geometry you see and each edit direct impacts the underlying objects. It is useful for quick prototyping, but likely won’t be used for the final product. Parametric modeling means that your design maintains the original geometry of each object even after you apply rounding and smoothing. You can define constraints, relations and dependencies to objects so that if you change something it will relatively impact other things. Parametric systems are usually history based, meaning you can go back into your model and adjust something (say the width of a line) and the software will automatically adjust everything that is related to it by constraints that you define. The downside to parametric modeling is that it is generally more complex. Take Blender, a parametric modeler, for example. I would argue that a lot of Blender’s complexity comes from it being a parametric modeling system. FreeCad is also a parametric modeler. It comes close to being a good combination of parametric with a direct modeler’s ease of use…but they aren’t there yet. For example, the design surface isn’t as rich as say 123D Design. Initially I was hesitant to look into DesignSpark Mechanical because it is a direct modeling tool, meaning that I can’t go back and edit the original geometry and set constraints, then I watched a couple of YouTube video tutorials and saw just how fast prototyping can be. I jumped in and spent a few hours with DesignSpark Mechanical and tried to recreate the same Chi Lego piece that I created with 123D Design. I did fairly well until I got to this point where I need to loft the bigger rectangle to the smaller rectangle that looks like it is floating. In 123D Design I would just select the two sides and hit loft. With DesignSpark Mechanical I couldn’t figure it out. I have an email out the support team, but in my opinion that functionality should be very easy to figure out on my own. I then tried to create a cone shaped object. I didn’t find a cone shape in their tool box, so I tried to create one one my own. I got as far as the screenshot below, but can’t complete the funnel without loft. I tried to create one on my own with a circle, offset, pull and adjust bottom, but I couldn’t figure out how to change the size of the bottom circle. I appears that I can only adjust the roundness of the corners. DesignSpark Mechanical might meet my needs in a future version, but I can’t see myself using this successfully without loft. I’m going to keep searching. btw – I am in contact with DesignSpark about these issues. I will update this post if they help me figure out what I’m missing. 3D Modeling Software Comparison Two WordsInexpensiveUser-FriendlyPreciseInspiringFeature Rich DesignSpark Mechanical GoodAttempt.

I’m looking for something that is in-expensive, user-friendly, precise and inspiring. Part 1 looked at SketchUp and 123D Design. Part 2 looked at Tinkercad. Part 3 looked at Blender and this post will take a look at FreeCad. FreeCad is a feature rich 3D parametric modeler and is great for mechanical parts with highly intricate designs. It is non-destructive, meaning that even though you manipulate and combine shapes the original shapes are still available for editing. It is precise in that you can set dimensions at any time. The interface is similar to Visual Studio in that it is made up of toolbars, menus and information panes. ProgramPriceProsCons FreeCad Free Feature rich. You can loft, fillet, sketch, extrude and pretty much anything else you need to build your designs. It’s open source and looks like there’s recent activity. Familiar (yet dated) interface. Active community forums, but not on StackExchange. The user-interface is dated. A lot of the settings are in information panes and not directly part of the drawing pane. For example, you can’t set a cylinder radius from the design surface, you have to find the property in a grid in one of the panes. I had to hunt for tutorials and a lot of them are dated. I found these video tutorials and there’s a good amount of documentation here, but I skipped it because I don’t think software should require reading to use. The ramp up doesn’t appear to be as high as Blender, but it’s still high. You will definitely need to watch the video tutorials to get a grasp of the concepts. User interface is dated – not as beautiful as say 123D Design. Here’s a shot of the interface: FreeCad has been around since 2011 and it appears to be gaining momentum, but it’s not at the same level of community involvement as Blender. In my opinion, if you are going to spend the time going deep on complex 3D modeling software you might want to go with Blender. I haven’t gone deep on either of them, but from the looks of it the ramp up time might be comparable and Blender is capable of much more. So if you spend the time ramping up on Blender then those skills would be transferable to things such as 3D animation if you ever wanted to learn that. Overall I did like my experience with FreeCad, but I couldn’t really figure out the basics on my own, such as cutting out a shape from another shape – even after watching a few of the videos, I got a little lost when I tried it on my own. I’m not ready to give up on it, because it has a lot going for it, but I’m going to move on to other options for now and come back to it later. I haven’t decided if I want to invest my time in FreeCad or Blender. They both have their strengths and weaknesses, but neither clicked as “the one” for me. 3D Modeling Software Comparison Two WordsInexpensiveUser-FriendlyPreciseInspiringFeature Rich FreeCad Promising.

Part 1 looked at SketchUp and 123D Design. Part 2 looked at Tinkercad. Here in part 3 I take a look at Blender. Blender is powerful and overwhelming. I installed it and tried to build some simple objects and couldn’t figure it out on my own, so I started to watch some of the videos and it slowly started to click. I was coming from the SketchUp, 123D and Tinkercad world where everything is visual and icon driven. Blender isn’t as user friendly as those options – but it is capable of so much more. ProgramPriceProsCons Blender Free, but I recommend paying $12 online or $32 download for the 3D printing training videos. As you can see from their feature list, Blend is very feature rich. You can do photorealistic editing, 3D modeling, 3D animation, simulations, video editing and much more. Blender is open source and appears to be very active and their latest release 2.73 was just a few days ago on 1/7/2015. Based on their releases page it looks like they release a new version every 3 months or so. They have a ton of tutorial videos for free. They have great training videos and one specifically for 3D printing for $12/month via the Blender Cloud. You could also just buy the 3D printing training DVD for $32. Blender has a TON of user community forums (including a StackExchange page). Blender can pretty much do anything you’d ever need with 3D modeling. That in itself is a positive, but you must be willing to invest time to learn it. Basic operations are either deep in a menu or in a keyboard shortcut – so you will have to get help from training videos or documentation to get started. There’s a big learning curve. Especially if you are used to Tinkercad and 123D Design. Here’s a shot of the interface. It’s overwhelming at first, but it gets better as you go through and learn what each thing does. This series is specifically targeting towards 3D printing for makers, some of which don’t have a lot of experience with complex software like IDEs. Coming from a Visual Studio or Photoshop, Blender would probably be a quick ramp up, but coming from Tinkercad would take much longer. Since Blender can do everything and anything, not just 3D modeling for 3D printing, I would say that the 3D printing training DVD or course is required. Blender is free itself, but the training is either $12/month online or $32 download. Not a huge deal financially, but something to consider. It would be a good investment since Blender looks like it will be around and active for a very long time. There’s a good Blender intro post on Hackaday that should give you a good idea of what the initial experience is like. There are a ton of comments on that post that range from “Blender is not the right choice for mechanical drawings and CAD” to “Blender is the best tool ever, just learn it”. Other than 3D modeling for 3D printing, I have no intention of doing anything else with 3D modeling, like animation and so on. While Blender is powerful I don’t think it’s the right choice for me or for makers because of the ramp up time. Yes, it can be done and probably fine if you already know it, but I don’t really want to invest the time it takes to learn all of it’s intricacies. I feel like a lot of the ramp up time is because it tries to do everything. I would prefer software that is specifically targeting towards 3D printing. 3D Modeling Software Comparison Two WordsInexpensiveUser-FriendlyPreciseInspiringFeature Rich Blender Powerful.

In part 1 of this series I looked at SketchUp and 123D Design. Someone suggested TinkerCad so I gave that a whirl. Program Price Pros Cons **[Tinkercad](http://tinkercad.com)** ![](/images/blog/cb6870fdb8c9_BDDE/image.png) Free I can't tell if they have a paid option or not. Web-based: You are always using the latest version – nothing to install. Great user experience. Looks beautiful and easy to figure things out on my own without much help. Unlike 123D Design you can resize objects to exact dimensions without having to use a factor. See my [part 1](/2015/01/3d-modeling-software-maker.html) post for details on that issue with 123D Design. [Amazing tutorial experience](https://www.tinkercad.com/quests/). They teach you the app by bringing you step-by-step through using what they call \"quests\". Shape generator JavaScript SDK. Looks like a cool community idea for sharing shapes. Web-based: You need an internet connection to use it and I found it to be on the slow side. Functionality is limited. I didn't find an option to round corners, loft, combine, tweak, etc. Can't select edges of objects and tweak. Everything is done by combing objects that are available in their toolbox. Overall Tinkercad is great for the beginner. I’m pretty sure their target demographic is someone just ramping up on 3D modeling who wants to learn some basic concepts. It would be great for my 4 year old, but it’s something I outgrew pretty quickly. They have some progressive ideas like the tutorial walkthroughs and shape generators (shapes that you create in JavaScript and can share). The tutorial experience: To find Shape Generators go to the right menu select Shape Generators and then Your Shape Generators The twisted polygon shape generator has params defined in main.js and the pane to the right is the consumer experience. You adjust the parameters with sliders. Very cool idea! (I personally don’t have a need for it at the moment, but I can see the potential). It’s great if you know JavaScript and want to contribute shapes back to the community. While this isn’t a software I would personally select because I need to be able to tweak a lot more than what Tinkercad provides, it still has a lot of value and was really fun to learn.

I do relatively small maker type enclosures and product designs. My requirements are: free or inexpensive, easy to use, precise and inspiring. I’m starting with the free options to see how far I can get. I’m going off of this Wikipedia list and recommendations from friends, but please feel free to make recommendations in the comments. Hopefully this post saves you some time as you go about researching your 3D modeling software options. Program Price Pros Cons **[SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/)** Make: Free for non-commercial Pro: $590 for commercial [Make vs Pro Comparison](http://help.sketchup.com/en/article/3000080) Great for drawing straight lines and exact measurements. Extensible with community plugins. Guide lines, protractor, rulers are very helpful when doing detailed work. Nearly impossible to create perfectly smooth lines and rounded corners. Feels very dated. I wasn't inspired to create beautiful models with it. I built this extender with SketchUp and it worked out well because it is made up of a lot of straight lines and I was happy with SketchUp. The extenders fit perfectly together. ![](/images/blog/a696917931fe_478E/image.png) But then I tried to build a wedding ring – an extruded circle with rounded corners. This is where SketchUp failed me. By default you can't round the corners of a curved face. ![](/images/blog/a696917931fe_478E/image_3.png) And the edge of the circle isn't a nice smooth round surface. Maybe there's a way to tweak that, but I want my modeling software to create smooth textures by default. I tried the \"Smooth option\", but it didn't work right away so I gave up. ![](/images/blog/a696917931fe_478E/image_4.png) There is a rounded corner extension [here](http://sketchucation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=323&amp;t=20485#p171721), but while I appreciate the effort didn't work for my ring. I did some rounded corners with it as shown below, but it was very difficult to get it perfect. ![](/images/blog/a696917931fe_478E/image_5.png) SketchUp is great for exact measurements, but lacks with curved beautiful drawings. I want both….so the search continues. Program Price Pros Cons **[Autodesk 123D Design](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/123d-apps)** Non-commercial Use: Free Premium: $10/month Great for fast prototyping and rough sketches. Right click orbits you around the model. Nearly impossible to change dimensions of objects. You can scale by a factor, but you end up doing math as you are modeling to get exact measurements. I quickly outgrew this app because I need exact measurements and I need to be able to print something and then go back and quickly tweak anything by a fraction of a millimeter. No default tool when you select an object. You always have to select and object and then select a tool. Lots of clicking. Menus are all flyouts and are finicky. After selecting an object, I have to move my mouse from my object to the top of the screen to hover over a menu, then hover over the tool I want, then click the tool, then go back to my object. Too much back and forth. You must learn the keyboard shortcuts. Doesn't allow you to use the ruler and the scale tool at the same time, so you have to measure, then switch tools, then measure, then switch, etc. Just to change dimensions It took me about an hour to create this Chi lego piece, but it wasn’t to scale. Since 123D Design doesn’t easily let you adjust objects to exact dimensions the thought of having to scale this down to size is daunting – I actually won’t even try. You’ll see why below. Here’s what I would have to do if I wanted to change the bottom cylinder to exactly 5.34mm diameter on the interior wall. Get the measurements by hitting the “I” key on the keyboard and see that it is 19.915mm. Then hit Esc key. Then open my calculator. 19.915 – 5.34 = 14.575. So I need to reduce my cylinder by 14.575mm. I then select the inner ring I enter –14.575, hit enter and it doesn’t move. Frustrating and I don’t know why it didn’t move. No message. I then try to scale the whole cylinder. I need to know the thickness of the cylinder wall, so I select the measure tool, select the interior wall and the exterior wall and see that it’s 1mm I want the interior wall to be 5.34mm plus the thickness of the wall that’s 6.34. So, 19.915 (diameter) – 6.34 – 13.575. I need to reduce my shape by 13.575mm. I select the shape, then select the Scale tool and try to resize by pulling the arrow. While I’m scaling it the software doesn’t tell me the size, just a factor. So now I need to figure out what factor of 19.915 I need to set it to. This is where I give up. Yes, I could figure that out, but I refuse to. There’s no way this will scale to real world precise modeling. My ring on the other hand, was super easy to create and I was happy with the print and even posted it to Thingiverse. I’m going to keep searching for the perfect mix of inexpensive, precise, beautiful and inspiring. Suggestions more than welcome.

I joined the Windows IoT Maker team not too long ago and have been immersing myself in the Maker space – I’ve been constantly thinking about how to connect everything to the internet and thinking about ways to build products myself. beakn started with an idea of building a completely wireless Lync Status light that I could put anywhere. The concept is simple. It’s a small hardware device that has LEDs that change to the color of your current Lync status. Red, Yellow, Green. I want to be able to have one at home and one at work and would like to stick it on the outside of my office door so people can see my status as they walk by. To achieve that it needs to be wireless – no USB, no ethernet and no power cables. beakn v0.1 focused on getting it working with USB and Arduino and executed serial commands. beakn v0.2 focused on getting it working with ethernet and Arduino/Netduino. beakn v0.3 focused on getting it working with RaspberryPi, C# with Mono and with v0.4&lt; I have achieved my goal of a completely wireless solution with Spark Core WiFi and batteries. Even though I now work with a team of people who know hardware and the Maker space way better than I do, I resisted the temptation to ask them for too much help. I started with searching the internet and took it one step at a time. I started with Arduino because that is what I had heard of, then Netduino and RaspberryPi. It’s been fun getting exposed to all the different types of boards, but the Spark Core is BY FAR the best experience I have had on this project. For my simple scenario the user experience far exceeds what is provided by Arduino and RaspberryPi out of the box. Spark Core has plenty of pins to connect my LEDS and has WiFi that doesn’t require any extra libraries. (Arduino UNO requires a WiFi shield and WiFi glue code). Spark Core also has a very simple cloud api that allows me to communicate with my device via HTTP. With my other solution I had to rely on an MQTT server – which logically just adds another piece to be concerned about. Aside: The WiFi network at Microsoft is WPA2-Enterprise which isn’t support by most of the micro-controller development boards, like RaspberryPi and Arduino. The Intel Edison was the only one that I found to support it. v0.4 will only work with the WiFi protocols that Spark Core supports, which is are simple home network security like WPA/WPA2 or WEP. See their troubleshooting guide if you run into issues. I developed this on my home network and will need to use a hotspot at work or switch to Edison. With v0.4 I also experimented with Surface Mount Device (SMD) LEDs and I added a power toggle switch. I still have the ping pong ball diffuser and an upgraded cardboard box. I switched it from the Intel Edison box to the Spark Core box. The Spark Core is tiny and my SMD LEDs are small so I could get away with a very small box. Spark Core Board The pictures speak for themselves. Super small and meets my needs. WiFi. GPIO pins. That’s all I need for this project. Photon is also coming soon. It’s $19 and it will work for beakn too. Spark IDE The Spark Core development experience is AMAZING. It is all done in the browser. I used Chrome to write the code, build it and deploy it to the Spark Core. They also have a desktop IDE as well that is based on GitHub’s atom. Here’s a screenshot showing the browser IDE. Here’s the desktop IDE. The other cool thing is that anyone can contribute libraries to Spark Core via GitHub. Check this out for more info. I contributed a “beakn” library so if you are building this then try searching the library for beakn and you should pull up the sample file. I was truly impressed with Spark Core. From initial setup to the IDE to the cloud apis to the very small form factor…everything was just perfect. The best thing about it is that I feel inspired to development more and I feel like I can actually get some other project ideas quickly off the ground. Products like this should first and foremost “inspire people to create” and the Spark Core definitely did that for me. WiFi For WiFi I didn’t have to do much. I just went through the Spark Core getting started guide and connected my Spark Core to my WiFi using the iPhone app. No libraries to import. It just works. Lights For SMD LEDs I have to admit that I asked someone on the team how to do solder them and he gave me a good lesson. I experimented a bunch with different ways to get them to attach to the protoboard and run wires to pins. With my first version I attached small pieces of wire wrapping wire to each LED, but with the second version I ran a single wire down each side. I reduced the resistance as well; I went from a 220ohm resistor to a 47ohm resistor. I’m not 100% sure that value is right, but it’s what an online ohms law calculator gave me – 3.3v and 20ma per LED. If you aren’t comfortable with SMD LEDs then I recommend going with any of the designs from v0.1, v0.2 or v0.3 which use 10mm big LEDs. Either option will work just fine. Diffuser I get a lot of compliments about using a ping pong ball, but of course that won’t be in the final product. This round I experimented with a clear plastic diffuser, but wasn’t happy with the results so I went back to the ping pong ball. Power My goal of developing a wireless device means it needs to run on battery. The Spark Core runs on 3.3V DC and needs an Input voltage of 3.6 to 6.0 volts. On this page they recommend a 3.6V LiPo or 4AAs. I had the 4AA battery case so that is what I went with. Since the beakn is now battery powered I threw a toggle switch in the circuit as well. Build the beakn Hardware Parts – You will need the following to build beakn v0.4 Spark Core – $39 Ping pong ball Small Cardboard box Duct Tape 4x AA Batteries &amp; 4AABattery Holder ToggleSwitch – I used the one that came with the Spark Core maker kit Small LED Route – Requires soldering * SMD LEDs – 3 Red, 3 Yellow, 3 Green – I found them at [SuperBrightLeds.com](https://www.superbrightleds.com/search/led-products/5050/) –You could also go with [RGBLEDs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10866), but you'd have to change the code a bit. I will eventually dowith RGB LEDs in a future version. WireWrapping Wire – To connect LEDs on PCB to pins 4x .1&quot; PitchHeaders – To connect LEDs to Spark Core 4x Female to Female Jumper Wires – To connect LEDs to Spark Core 2x Male to Female Jumper Wires – To connect Toggle Switch Prototyping Board Tweezers Wire Cutters/Strippers Heat Shrink Soldering Iron Solder Heat gun or hair dryer – To shrink the heat shrink Drill 1/4&quot; Drill Bit* Big LED Route – Doesn’t require soldering The Box 1. Get a clean box by removing any extra cardboard that is inside it. 2. Cut a hole in the front for the toggle switch. 3. Cut a hold in the top for the lights. The Ball Cut a hole in the bottom of the ping pong ball and duct tape it to the hole in the top of the box. The SMD LED Array 1. Drill a 3x3 grid into the Prototyping board to hold the LEDs in place. You are going to run wire to connect the negative and positive terminals so make sure all the sides are the same. Negative on right, positive on left for all of them. The negative side has a little notch in the corner. 2. Dab a very small amount of solder to connect all three leads of each side. 3. Lay a piece of wire wrapping wire across the negative side and solder in place. Do the same for positive and do for all 9 LEDs. 4. Connect all of the negative wires together with a 47ohm resistor and solder to a header. Be sure to keep the insulation on the wire because the positive wires will run on top of them. 5. Connect each positive wire of each row of LEDs to a header pin. 6. Duct tape the board to the top of the box. 7. Use the female to female wires to connect the headers to the Spark Core Red: D5 Yellow: D6 Green: D7 Ground: GND The Batteries and Toggle Switch Your battery holder likely came with tinned ends. Cut the 2x male to female jumper wires and solder the switch in between them. This page was helpful when researching toggle switch wiring. Connect the red wire to Spark Core VIN and the black wire to Spark Core GND. Put the batteries in the battery holder and you should see the Spark Core start up. The final product Install the beakn Desktop Application The beakn desktop application runs in the background and listens for Lync status changes. When that occurs it issues an HTTP request to the Spark Cloud API to tell the device what color to show. I found this VERY helpful library called SharpSpark. It was super easy to use – I’ve asked them to put on nuget, but for now you have to get the code and build it locally. To install the desktop app you can: 1. Get the source, build it and run it: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/tree/master/desktop 2. Install via the v0.4 MSI: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/download/v0.4/beakn.v0.4.msi After you install it you are going to need to modify the config to use your Spark Core keys. 1. If beakn.exe is running you’ll need to stop it. 2. Open a CMD prompt as Admin and open beakn.exe.config in notepad. 3. Change the Protocol setting to “SparkCore” 4. Change the AccessToken and DeviceId to the IDs you get from Spark.io &amp;lt;add key=&quot;SparkCoreAccessToken&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&amp;gt; // [http://spark.io](http://spark.io) – click on settings in lower left &amp;lt;add key=&quot;SparkCoreDeviceId&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&amp;gt; // [http://spark.io](http://spark.io) – click on cores in lower left, select your core 5. Save it. 6. Double-click on beakn.exe to restart it. Install the Spark Core beakn Code This is the code that sits on your Spark Core. It is going to set the appropriate LED color. You will notice that there is a call to “Spark.function(“setStatus”, setStatus);” That is a method included in the Spark Core development experience. It sets up the setStatus function as a function that can be called via HTTP with their Cloud API. Amazingly simple. This functionality was much more code in my previous versions because I had to talk to MQTT servers directly. You can get the code in two ways: 1. Search the Spark libraries for “beakn”. http://spark.io, Libraries, search for beakn. Directly use the beakn-sparkcore.ino example file. 2. Go to the beakn-sparkcore GitHub repository and copy the code to the Spark Core IDE and deploy to your device. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jongio/beakn-sparkcore/master/firmware/examples/beakn-sparkcore.ino Fire it up Turn on your beakn using your toggle switch. It will flash red, yellow and then green when it starts up. After that you’ll need to change your Lync status to get it initialized. (I’m researching ways to automatically pull the latest status – for now just toggle). This version was definitely more involved than the others. The SMD LEDs and custom protoboard made it fun, but also more challenging. I had a blast building it. I look forward to seeing what you do with it.

This is what I’m calling a “maker experience” project. I want to know what a maker goes through to build things so I’m building it with as many different platforms as possible. I’ve built it with Arduino and Netduino. Version 0.1 brought us a USB connected light. Version 0.2 introduced Ethernet and MQTT. Version 0.3 includes the following: RaspberryPi running a .NET Console app via Mono Upgraded my breadboard to a custom shield. Up until a few days ago I didn’t realize (or it didn’t click) that we could run .NET applications on RaspberryPi. I’ve heard about Mono, but haven’t really have a chance to play with it enough for it to sink in. MS Open Tech released ConnectTheDots.io (a site to help people get up and going with IoT devices and Azure) this week and in that they have a RaspberryPiGateway – which uses a .NET console app and Mono. I saw that. It clicked - and of course I had to give it a try for beakn, which led to this post. I just did a post on “How to run .NET on RaspberryPi with Mono”, so start there to see how things work and then come back to build the beakn. I also recommend that you read through the v0.1 and v0.2 posts before moving on so you can see how we got to this point. The “beakn” has three main components 1. A Windows desktop application that sends messages to an MQTT broker when your Lync status changes 2. An MQTT broker to receive the Lync status messages 3. A hardware app that responds to MQTT messages and sets the right LED. Red=Busy, Yellow=Away, Green=Free #1 and #2 above have changed very little with this version and #3 is now a RaspberryPi instead of an Arduino or Netduino. Here’s how to get v0.3 setup on your own. Step 0: Get the beakn Hardware setup Supplies 1. Ping Pong Ball 2. Cardboard box 3. Breadboard or protoboard. I’m now using a protoboard instead of breadboard. Mainly because I was taking this thing apart so many times and it was become a pain to get everything setup each time. 4. RaspberryPi Model B or any model with Ethernet 5. 3 10mm LEDs 6. Some Jumper wires. Number of wires depends on how you build. 7. 220ohm resistor Everything (except the RaspberryPi is the same as v0.2 so please read through that first. Connect the LEDs like so: Board Pin 12: Red Board Pin 16: Yellow Board Pin 18: Green Put a 220ohm resistor on the cathode. See photos and circuit diagram for possible setup. [ As you can see my cardboard box has seen better days, but you’ll likely need to cut a few more holes to get the Ethernet and USB Power connected. Step 1: Install or Build the beakn desktop application. You can install the desktop app directly from GitHub here: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/download/v0.3/beakn.v0.3.msi Or you can get the source and build it yourself https://github.com/jongio/beakn/tree/master/desktop Step 2: Modify the beakn.exe.config file Open a CMD prompt as Administrator and navigate to the beakn install directory. Change the MqttPairingCode to something unique. Remember what you set this to because you’ll need it later when you install RaspberryPi app. Restart beakn.exe. You go into Task Manager and kill it first. Sorry not having a better solution here. Will fix at some point. Step 3: Install the RaspberryPi .NET Console app. Go through my “How to run .NET on RaspberryPi with Mono” post to get Mono and working on Pi. You can either copy the compiled version onto your Pi from this zip: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/download/v0.3/beakn.raspberrypi.v0.3.zip Or you can get the source and built yourself: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/tree/master/raspberrypi/beakn.raspberrypi The console app that runs on the Pi is plain jane stock .NET without Xamarin Studio. It uses the M2Mqtt library to talk with the MQTT broker and Raspberry.IO.GeneralPurpose library to talk to the RaspberryPi pins. Step 4: Modify the RaspberryPi beakn.exe.config file Open the config file and change the MqttPairingCode to the same code you used in Step 2 above. You can do this directly on the Pi with “sudo nano beakn.exe.config” or you can do on desktop and copy over. Step 5: Run the RaspberryPi beakn.exe using this command. sudo mono beakn.exe You should see something like this: Step 6: Make RaspberryPi beakn automatically start Linux uses /etc/rc.local to list projects that automatically start when the Pi is started. This link was helpful: http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-operating-systems/raspbian/auto-running-programs Open rc.local to edit. sudo nano /etc/rc.local Add this line, your path to beakn.exe is where you copied it to – likely different than below. sudo mono /home/pi/beakn/beakn.exe &amp;amp; That’s it! You should now see your beakn change color when your Lync status changes.

When I joined IoT and started getting ramped up, I quickly discovered that it is largely an unmanaged non-.net non-Microsoft world. I’m having a blast learning everything, but I can’t get over the hunch that there are a bunch of devs out there who want to be makers, but aren’t because of the disconnect in technology. I’m positive this mindset is out there: “I want to be a maker, but I don’t know Linux, I don’t know c++ and I don’t have a ton of time to learn everything”. My new passion is helping Microsoft learn about, discover and adapt to the maker movement and meet people where they are and to help Microsoft-tech developers become makers. Microsoft-tech devs have a couple of options. You could get a Netduino or Gadgeteer - which run on the .NET Micro Framework. You could get a Galileo – which runs Windows. But did you know that you could also use .NET on RaspberryPi with Mono? People typically use python on RaspberryPi, but if your comfort zone is .NET then .NET on RaspberryPi with Mono is worth checking out. In this post we’ll build a standard .NET console app with Visual Studio and run it on a RaspberryPi with Mono. The only real magic is Mono, the rest is stock .NET. I don’t even need Mono on my Windows machine. I just write a Console app like I do any other Console app. Deploy it to my Pi and run it with Mono. Xamarin Studio is not required. Let’s build a simple Blinky console app (which is the Hello World for maker projects). I’ll show you how to get your RaspberryPi setup with Mono, how to write to pins and how to deploy and run your code. I’m using Visual Studio 2013, RaspberryPi model B and Windows 8.1. RaspberryPi Setup 1. Setup Linux on Pi Get Occidentalis v0.2 https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2 Make Occidentalis SD card https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-lesson-1-preparing-and-sd-card-for-your-raspberry-pi/making-an-sd-card-using-a-windows-vista-slash-7 Run first time config https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-2-first-time-configuration 2. Configure Network Plug Ethernet Cable into PiSetup Samba for NetBIOS name or give it a static IP. This is so you can deploy your code to the Pi Samba route: http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-SMB.html – Takes longer than static IP route, but better long term.

Setup Remote Desktop (Optional) This is so you can use your main computer's mouse and keyboard instead of having to go back and forth between the Pi and your desktop. I've found this link the quickest way with xrdp[http://www.maketecheasier.com/enabling-remote-desktop-access-on-raspberry-pi/](http://www.maketecheasier.com/enabling-remote-desktop-access-on-raspberry-pi/ \"http://www.maketecheasier.com/enabling-remote-desktop-access-on-raspberry-pi/\") 4. Setup SFTP You are going to deploy your code from your Windows machine to your Pi via SFTP. Here's how with FileZilla http://trevorappleton.blogspot.com/2014/03/remotely-copy-files-to-and-from-your.html 5. Install Mono Run this command from RaspberryPi terminal to install mono. sudo apt-get install mono-complete 6. Setup LED This is intentionally very simple because this post is about showing .NET on Pi versus what can be done with Pi. 1x LED 1x 220ohm resistor 1x Breadboard 2x Jumper Wires There are two ways to look at Pi wiring Board layout and BCM, this is great resource for making sure you are using the right pin numbers: http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout. We’ll use the “Board” physical layout, so the 6th pin down from the outer rail is 12. 1. Place LED in breadboard 2. Connect Pin 18 to LED Annode (the long lead) via jumper wire. 3. Connect Ground to breadboard 4. Connect resistor from Ground to LED Cathode (the short lead) [ C# Console App We are going to use the stock Visual Studio C# console app template. Go ahead and create a Console app. We are going to also use the Raspberry.IO.GeneralPurpose nuget package to talk to the GPIO pin 18. Go ahead and add a reference to that. GPIO = General Purpose Input Output That library has a Toggle method so let’s just use it. The code is super simple. Just configure the pin, init a GpioConnection and call Toggle. This code is also on GitHub: https://github.com/jongio/dotnet-raspberrypi-mono using Raspberry.IO.GeneralPurpose;using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Linq;using System.Text;using System.Threading;using System.Threading.Tasks;namespace dotnet_raspberrypi_mono&#123; class Program &#123; static void Main(string[] args) &#123; OutputPinConfiguration pin12 = ConnectorPin.P1Pin12.Output(); pin12.Enabled = false; using (GpioConnection connection = new GpioConnection(pin12)) &#123; while (!Console.KeyAvailable) &#123; connection.Toggle(pin12); Thread.Sleep(250); &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125; Build the app in Visual Studio. Deploy to RaspberryPi If using samba w/ mapped drive, just output the code to the drive. If using FileZilla then just copy the bin/Debug folder to a folder in a directory such as /home/pi/dotnet-raspberrypi-mono It’s just an xcopy deploy. Run app on Pi Log into your Pi. Open a terminal. Navigate to the exe you just copied over and execute this command. sudo mono dotnet-raspberrypi-mono.exe Your LED should now be blinking! I hope this quick sample gets you going with RaspberryPi and .NET – and helps you become a maker.

I started with it being USB connected (beakn v0.1), then Ethernet (beak v0.2) and now I’m looking into wireless communication. When I was looking at Ethernet I was researching Arduino ethernet shields and came across the Arduino Ethernet Shield with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) Module. I didn’t research the requirements much, I just thought it would be great to have an Ethernet option and only run one cable and get both Ethernet and power – so I ordered it. _ _ (Arduino Ethernet Shield with PoE) What I didn’t realize is that power isn’t provided over ethernet by default. When I plugged the ethernet cable into the shield I thought it would power up, but it didn’t. I spent a lot of time researching settings or configuration for it, but found nothing. I bypassed my router and went directly to the source to see if it was an issue with my router. Still no luck. I then (using this guide)built a cable that I thought could be used to get power out of the ethernet cable. (My custom PoE cable) It then came to me that power might not be provided by default. So I searched for “router PoE” and discovered that there are indeed PoE enabled routers and I didn’t have one. (PoE router) I also at the same time pinged a co-worker, who is an EE – Hardware guru and he had this to say: PoE means that every single device on the chain from PSE (power sourcing equipment) to PD (powered device) must be PoE capabled\\aware.In order to get PoE working the PD presents a certain signature on the line which PSE picks up on and initiates a short preamble (detection, classification, mark, class, startup) with PD.Thus PoE is usually point to point – as in, a power injector injects power just after the final switch. In short that means that the Arduino Ethernet with PoE shield isn’t just going to work without a PoE enabled chain. Yes, you could get a PoE router or midspan device, but this is where I drew the line for my project. I likely won’t have an Ethernet version (remember my goal of being completely wireless) and I definitely don’t want to require my users to have to purchase a PoE router or midspan device. Going down this PoE path was a good learning experience, but I’m not going to pursue it for beakn. I’m going to keep going down the wireless / battery powered path and leave PoE for a future project. Hope this saves you some time while researching PoE options.

It’s a Lync status light that lights up red, yellow or green based on your Lync status. beakn v0.1 was all about getting it working without it being too complex – so I opted for using the USB connection from my computer to the Arduino and then send Serial commands over that connection to tell the Arduino what LED to light up. My ultimate goal of the project is to get into the shoes of a maker and see what it takes to take a product from inception to proof of concept to prototype and finally to production. The end product will be a completely wireless Lync status light that you place anywhere in your office, home or oil rig. beakn v0.2 gets us one step closer by introducing Ethernet and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), which is VERY light weight pub-sub messaging protocol for IoT devices (wikipedia). I spent a lot of time working with the Arduino WiFi shield as well, but I couldn’t get it stabilized in time for the v0.2 release. Also in that process I realized that WiFi is probably out of the picture because of the setup and config that is involved – you have to get the SSID and Password into the sketch and upload it via the IDE, which isn’t something I want my early adopters to have to do. I will likely end up going with a gateway device connected to Ethernet that listens for MQTT events and sends commands to the beakn via Bluetooth LE or Xbee. That was a rat hole I didn’t want to go down for this version. Also, with regard to power, I want it to run on battery – the problem is that the Uno and the WiFi shield together won’t run for very long on a 9V. I dug into what it would take to power the beakn, but didn’t get too far. I’m thinking I’m going to have to deal with that in the prototype phase…I still consider this to be in the proof of concept phase. Prototype will move away from Arduino and onto getting individual microcontrollers, surface mount LEDs, power management and a 3D printed enclosure. This entire project is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/ If you are new to beakn it might be a good idea for you to read through the beakn v0.1 post Here are some pictures of the v0.2 build The design includes: 1. Arduino or Netduino with 3 LEDs 2. Ethernet Shield 3. MQTT 4. Desktop Application The app flow is: You have a desktop application that listens for Lync status change events and publishes a status message to the MQTT topic with the current status. The Arduino/Netduino subscribe to that same MQTT topic and changes the LED color based on the payload of the message. Here are some of the changes in v0.2 The Arduino Uno does not come with an ethernet connectivity, so I had to get an ethernet shield. I opted for the Power Over Ethernet version – but didn’t focus on getting PoE working for this version – you need a power adapter for v0.2. If you are going to stick with Arduino and don’t have one yet, then get the Yun instead. It comes with an Ethernet port.* There are a couple of MQTT Arduino libraries out there and I decided to use the Arduino Client for MQTT because it looked simple enough and I got it running pretty quickly. The beakn desktop application is much more stable and won’t lose connection when you sign in and out of Lync. It will lose connection if you completely exit Lync. I spent a bit of time researching that, but just decided to address that issue later. For MQTT on the desktop app I decided to use M2Mqtt because it looks like it is the only game in town and they have a nuGet package. There are a couple of free MQTT services out there to test things out and I decided to use a HiveMQ one here: http://mqttdashboard.com/info/broker. There also GnatMQ, but I couldn’t find a freely available version online. Obviously if you productionize this you are going to want to get your own MQTT server going. The Arduino LED pin numbers have changed because the Ethernet shield uses some of the pins I was using before. As a C#/JavaScript developer it was a big relief to work with the Netduino. It’s nice to be back in Visual Studio and C# and it was great that the M2Mqtt library was available. I didn’t get the Serial version working on Netduino, but that’s not important at this stage because of my wireless goal. I’m going to keep prototyping with the Arduino to see what is possible, but as a long time Microsoft developer the Netduino is definitely preferred. Being able to use nuGet is sweet too. Here’s what you need to do to build this yourself: **1. Follow the hardware instructions for **beakn v0.1 Carve out a little more space in the back of the box for Ethernet and Power For Netduino Wire the pins as follows:* For Arduino 2. Deploy the sketch to the Arduino or Netduino For Arduino Open this sketch in the Arduino IDE. Change both topicName and clientName to something unique. It can be whatever you want it to be.* Deploy the sketch to your Arduino* For Netduino **3. Install the **beakn v0.2 desktop app or get the code here and compile it yourself. 4. Update the beakn.exe.config file. [Only do this if you installed via msi installer] Open CMD as Admin. Navigate to the beakn install directory. Execute “notepad beakn.exe.config” Change the “MqttPairingCode” setting to something unique. It can be anything, but it must match the same MqttPairingCode that you used in your Arduino or Netduino app. KNOWN ISSUES beakn will lose the connection if you completely exit Lync. You’ll need to restart beakn.exe if you close Lync. You must first plug in the ethernet cable, then power when you setup the beakn. The init script runs when it boots and if the Ethernet isn’t there it will jus fail. That should be all there is to it. Let me know if you run into any other issues and follow me on twitter to get updates of future version. Jon p.s. Just for kicks – I wired up this full size traffic light in my office as a beakn – it’s super bright and very hot!","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"IoT","slug":"Tech/IoT","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/IoT/"}],"tags":[{"name":"iot","slug":"iot","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/iot/"}]},{"title":"How to trade in your old Canon camera for a discounted refurbished one with the Canon Loyalty Program","slug":"canon-loyalty-program","date":"2014-12-10T16:10:00.000Z","updated":"2017-01-20T22:14:47.735Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/12/canon-loyalty-program/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2014/12/canon-loyalty-program/","excerpt":"","text":"Canon has a program called the “Customer Loyalty Program” that allows you to send in your broken Canon camera and get a refurbished camera at a discount.

There’s no better way to do that than to build something. I believe that to truly learn something you have to struggle through it with your own hands. For my first “maker experience” project I decided to build a light that represents your Lync status. When Busy it will be red, when Away, yellow and when available it will be green. Yes, it’s very simple, but that’s intentional. I wanted the first project to be more about learning the maker process and not building something complex. I’m calling this project “beakn” because a beacon is defined as a light set up in a high or prominent position as a warning, signal or celebration. It will be placed on your desk at work or home to let people know when it’s ok or not to disturb you. The first version will require an app to be running on your Windows machine and a constant USB connection to the beakn. Later versions will be wifi enabled and battery powered so you can place them anywhere without wires. Let’s first talk about the hardware and build it physically. The beakn Hardware Components Arduino – I used an Uno, but any Arduino with 3 outputs and a serial port will work. 1 Half-size Breadboard 1 USB A to B-Type cable to connect Arduino to computer 3 10mm Diffused LEDs. One red, one yellow, one green. 3 220ohm, 1/4W Resistors 6 Jumper Wires Male/Female – For connecting LEDs to breadboard and Arduino 1 Ping Pong Ball 1 Box – I used an Intel Edison box that I had, which is 6&quot;L x 3.5&quot;W x 2&quot;H. You can make one out of scrap cardboard if you don’t have one handy. Tools A drill to cut holes in the ping pong ball A drill or xacto knife to cut holes in cardboard box Build Instructions Step 1 Gather all of the components listed above. Step 2 Connect the Arduino, Resistors and 3 LEDs like so: Ground: Arduino Ground to breadboard ground Anodes: Red LED Anode pin to PIN9 Yellow LED Anode pin to PIN10 Green LED Anode to PIN11 Cathodes: Red LED Cathode pin to 220ohm resistor to GND Yellow LED Cathode pin to 220ohm resistor to GND Green LED Cathode pin to 220ohm resistor to GND Step 3 Drill holes into the Ping Pong ball like so. The walls of the ping pong ball are VERY thin and will rip so please make sure you use pilot holes starting from the smallest bit and then move up to a bit that is a little smaller than 10mm. Step 4 Carve holes in box. Carve a 1 inch hold in middle of top of box for the ping pong ball Carve a square .5 inch hole in the back of the box for the USB cable. Step 5 Put Arduino, breadboard and lights into box. Stuff the LEDs through the top hole and into the ping pong ball. Stuff the ping pong ball into the hole. The rims of the LEDs will keep it in place. Step 6 Connect the USB cable and close the box. ] ] That’s all there is to it. We’ll do RGB LEDs, Blinkm and surface mount LEDs in later versions, but what we have so far is a good start. The beakn Software This first version of beakn uses serial communication to communicate from your desktop to the Arduino. The two main components of the software are: Desktop App You will need a desktop application that uses the Lync SDK to listen for Lync events and Command Messenger to communicate with the Arduino. This is a Windows Form application that doesn’t have a UI. It’s a form, not a Windows service because it needs to run under the context of the currently logged in user and a Windows Service is machine level. You can install this app from GitHub here: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/tag/v0.1. Click the beakn-0.1.msi green button and install. Or you can get the source and build it yourself: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/tree/master/desktop (that is the latest code) if you want to download the code as of v0.1 then use this link and click the “source code” button. https://github.com/jongio/beakn/releases/tag/v0.1 The default COM port is COM3. Check Device Manager to see what COM port your Arduino is on and adjust the beakn.exe.config file to match that. The meat of the app is in Serial.cs. Serial.cs uses CmdMessenger to initiate and communicate with the Arduino. Controller.cs uses the Lync SDK to handle Lync status change events I also created a wrapper around the Lync SDK called lyncx, which you can find the source for here: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/blob/master/desktop/lyncx/lyncx/LyncxClient.cs Arduino Sketch You will need an Arduino sketch to receive the serial command and turn the appropriate LED. You can download the Arduino sketch here: https://github.com/jongio/beakn/tree/master/arduino/beakn.arduino.digital.sketch. Open it in your Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino. You will need to have the CmdMessenger.h file in your Arduino libraries folder (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Arduino\\libraries\\CmdMessenger), which you can get here: https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-CmdMessenger The “loop” of the sketch listens for serial events and uses the readStringArg method of CmdMessenger to get the current availability status and then calls analogWrite to set the colors of each of the ping. I’m using analogWrite instead of digitialWrite here because I will use an RGB LED in a future version. Test it out After you install the desktop app and upload your sketch the ping pong ball should turn the color of your Lync status! Play with changing your Lync status and see if the color changes. I’m hoping it does! ] I haven’t fully tested the software side of things – so LMK if you run into any issues at all and I’ll try to help out. Thanks for following along. Feedback is more than welcome. The next revision should be done before the end of the week. The next step is getting rid of that breadboard.

Adafruit has a good step-by-step tutorial, but it’s not up-to-date and it’s for the PN532 breakout board not the PN532 shield. They also have this one for Arduino – it’s not RaspberryPi, but still helpful for understanding the concepts. Here’s how I got it going – hope this saves you some time. 1. Get Occidentalis v0.2 https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2 2.

Prepare the PN532 When I was going through this I was going under the assumption that libnfc only worked in UART mode (because that is what I found on from many sources), but I later found that it does support I2C and SPI. To get PN532 in UART mode you need to solder SEL0 on the board (make sure you are soldering SEL closest to MOSI on the board. In v.1 of PN532 SEL0 and SEL1 labels were reversed. I found that info here: http://www.mobilefish.com/developer/libnfc/libnfc_quickguide_adafruit.html 7. Wire up the PN532 to the breadboard and the RaspberryPi Connect 5v power and GND from RaspberryPi to breadboard Connect 5v power and GND from PN532 to breadboard The PN532 outputs 5V, but the RaspberryPi TXD and RXD pins are rated for 3.3V so we need to put a 220ohm resistor between them. Connect PN532 SCL to RaspberryPi TXD with a 220ohm resistor between them Connect PN532 SDA to RaspberryPi RXD with a 220ohm resistor between them 8. Test it out https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-nfc-rfid-on-raspberry-pi/testing-it-out After running nfc-poll and swiping a card you should see your UID – which means it is working!

Back in 2004, five years into my software dev career, I made the move from independent contractor to Microsoft employee. Five years into my Microsoft career, I made the move from web dev to mobile app dev because I wanted to do something different. Bing offered “search” and “mobile apps” – two things I had never had a chance to focus on. After a year in Bing, I moved to MSN because I wanted to learn how very large sites are developed and four years after that I moved to Ads for a special project. Then, five years after moving to Bing, and 15 years into my career, I got the itch to try something completely different. Something that would stretch me and something that was “uniquely Microsoft”. Bing, MSN and Ads presented a lot of challenges and I learned a lot, but I always felt like I could get that experience at any large company. After my “super secret project” was cancelled over a year ago, I spent a lot of time searching for something that met my very high bar of being fun, interesting, challenging and meaningful. I interviewed with many teams and many external companies – but never ended up finding that perfect fit for this season of my career. Until now. When I was looking for something new I wasn’t overly concerned with title or team size. I wanted something to obsess about. Something that I could put my whole energy into. Something that I wouldn’t quickly lose interest in. Something that was more than just developing software and services. So, after months of searching I finally found what appears to be the perfect fit in the Internet of Things team at Microsoft. I’m on my third week on the team and it’s pretty awesome. I spent my first week ramping up on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Galileo, Netduino, Python, NFC, C/C++, .NET Micro Framework and electronics. Yesterday, I relearned how to solder and tomorrow I get ramped up on 3D printing. It’s so much fun. The most fun I have had at Microsoft. There’s so much I don’t know and that’s what I love about this role. A big part of why they brought me on is because of 15 years of software and services experience and I will definitely help out with all of that, but I want to be able to develop IoT solutions end to end so I’m starting from the ground up. I want to get into the mind of the maker and figure out how Microsoft can be part of that space. The team here is great – they are embedded/robotics/automotive people who have so much more knowledge than me, but are super graceful and patient with me and all my n00b questions. Another big part of this role is that I get to hire a few devs. Once again I get the opportunity to build a team – which I love doing. I love recruiting because I get to talk with so many talented devs and I always learn a lot throughout that process. But this time it’s different. I’m not looking for web devs this time, I’m looking for devs with the maker mindset. Devs who love hacking hardware. Devs who get excited about things like home automation and connected everything. Devs who can talk with customers. Devs who can experiement, prototype and get ramped up on all things IoT and produce end to end proof of concepts. Devs who love the cloud. It’s basically Satya’s Cloud+Mobile vision coming to life. That’s got to be you. If the above resonates with you then I strongly suggest you apply. Here’s how: Send me your resume via this form: http://bit.ly/emailjon – Include a short blurb about why you are the perfect dev for this team. Include all the IoT/Maker/Embedded stuff that you have created. It would also be good to mention any customer facing work you have done. Officially apply for the job here: http://bit.ly/msiotdev Here’s the full job description: The Internet of Things is upon us and will revolutionize the enterprise and consumer experience with both the internet and the physical world around us.

Optimization is built into their DNA. We are always looking for ways to not repeat ourselves and strive to make everything we do faster. Everything from doing the dishes to serialization. If it’s not as fast as it possibly could be, then we spend countless hours making it so. Now as a manager I get to code a bit, but a big part of what I’m responsible for is optimizing developer productivity. I have a long way to go, but I have definitely improved as a manager over the last 10 years, so I thought I would share what I have learned. You’ll see two approaches below. The left column is written from the perspective of the out of touch manager and the right column is written from my point of view. Hopefully you’ll get a laugh or two out of the former. Hours That Guy This Guy The first thing you want to do is set the expectation that your developers will be working very long hours. They should be working from the moment they wake up to the moment they fall asleep. If not coding that whole time, they should at least be thinking about code. I find it best to set mandatory in-office core hours from 8am to 8pm. That way they get in a solid 12 hours a day in the office and then they can make up the remaining 4 hours of their 16 hour day on their own time. It’s fine if they chose to come in earlier or stay later, but everyone must be in their office for core hours. Try roaming the halls at the start and end of each day and take notes on who is and isn’t in their office. That way you know who the really productive people are. You could also go the punch card route or you could require them to install a service that monitors their activity and alerts you when they aren’t meeting their numbers. On my team the expectation is that you’ll work roughly 8 hours a day, but it is very self-managed. Some days you’ll work 10, some days you’ll work 6. I never track developer hours. The code you produce speaks for itself. I work an hour or so in the morning, get in around 9:30, leave at 4:30, then I’m back at it for a bit before I go to sleep. That allows me to eat breakfast and dinner with my family on a regular basis. I’m never going to stop someone from working long hours. Some love pulling all-nighters. I might give a nudge here and there that someone might want to rest, but we are all grown-ups and should be able to recognize when we need a break. Meetings That Guy This Guy If there’s one thing I know, it is that developers love meetings. Especially meetings where they have nothing to contribute. They can just sit there and nod and pretend to be listening, which is a great opportunity for them to stress about all the code they need to write. The two best types of meetings are all-day meetings and ad-hoc meetings. If you do an all-day meeting, make sure you still follow the 16 hour a day rule and also make sure it is well known that “meeting time” doesn’t count against core working hours. For example, an all-day 8 hour meeting equates to a 24 (16+8) hour work day. Ad-hoc meetings are also very helpful. Those are the kind of meetings where you randomly stop by to see how things are going, see if they need anything and check if their work is done yet. I usually put a reminder on my calendar every 45 minutes to get up, see who is in their office and ask them questions that help them context switch. After all…context switching is a skill that is learned – and it’s your job to develop your team. By all means do not do one-on-one meetings, especially when you become a manager of managers. If you have tons of people on your team, there’s no way you can meet with them all, so don’t meet with any of them. If you want to know how your devs are doing, just send them a survey and pretend like you thought about the responses. Do not do “No meeting Fridays” or “No meeting afternoons” and put a 30-60 minute gap in between meetings so they can get a good 20 minutes of coding time in between them. At the end of the day they should spend 80% of their time in meetings and 20% of their time developing. Meetings are necessary, but can be optimized. On my team all recurring meetings are scheduled before noon and we suggest that all meetings take place in the morning, so Devs have the afternoon to get into the Flow. I’m a manager of managers and I meet one-on-one with every FTE on my team at least every three weeks. I get a lot out of those meetings…I’m usually the one who comes away with action items. Everyone also just got Blync lights to help minimize context switching via ad-hoc-stop-bys when someone is trying to get into the Flow. WFH That Guy This Guy Working from home?...it should be……“Xboxing from home” because you know that’s what they are doing all day. It’s a trick. Don’t fall for it. You can let them have every other Sunday to themselves if they are hitting their “lines of code” count and code coverage percentage for the month. But, never on a regular basis. When someone says they need to work from home immediately schedule an early morning meeting and require them to be there in person. Most of my team has regular “work from home” days and just yesterday Will and David paired at Cafe Cesura for an afternoon. I usually use Fridays as my WFH day, but I’m flexible. If a dev can honestly say they are more productive at home or if they want to save an hour in driving then that’s cool. You want them to figure out what sets them up for success and support it. Software That Guy This Guy When you get developers the latest versions of software it just means they are going to spend a bunch of time learning how to use it, which is valuable time away from coding. Visual Studio 2005 is fine, don’t let them convince you otherwise. Everything that was ever needed was in .NET 1.0, so don’t waste your time hearing arguments about upgrading to .NET 4.5 – async/await…blah blah blah. If they coded things right in the first place they wouldn’t need to process so many things at once. When it comes to software, get them whatever they need. My whole team runs on the latest version of VS (2013) uses ReSharper and Web Essentials…and many more. The tools were created for the sole purpose of developer productivity, so embrace them. Let your team experiment with new VS add-ons or other editors (try WebStorm for example). In the whole scheme of things it’s not worth it to skimp on Dev Tools. You may spend thousands on tools, but that can result in much more savings in dev hours and frustration. Cloud That Guy This Guy Developers heads are in the cloud enough as it is. All good software that was ever created is sitting on a computer under someone’s desk. Every once in a while you get a site that takes off, like Twitter, and you need to do shared hosting, but we aren’t Twitter. The cloud is just a buzzword cooked up by marketing folks. All clouds eventually precipitate and disappear – see “the water cycle”. I’m not making this up. That’s just science. If you really want a productive dev then they need to know how to mount physical servers on racks and swap out hard drives when they fail. As far as work items management and bug tracking, you definitely want that in Excel and on an internal SharePoint site so they have to VPN to get to it from home. I was going to say that the Cloud is the future, but it’s not. It’s the present. Are you still running your stack on-prem? Come up with a plan to get it to the cloud. Developers love the Cloud because it greatly simplifies the part of their job that they just inherited when they became a combined engineer. Push, push, push - everything cloud all the time. Everything from your source to your production bits to your work items should be in the cloud. DevOps That Guy This Guy Back when I started out as a dev I did everything. Developers these days label that “DevOps” and think it’s something new. What can be better than copying and pasting code from your /bin/debug folder to prod? Or better yet, just have them write a script to copy every local build to prod. That, my friend, is agility. Get consistent about your deployments and code sharing. Learn how to dynamically scale with Azure or AWS. Simplifying deployments, environments and scale simply leads to a more productive developer because they can focus on creating. Encourage them to come up with new ways to save time. There’s a big effort on my team right now to automate every piece of our deployment and compliance process so we can get back to coding. The criteria for a DevOps task is 1) Do we need to do this thing? 2) If yes, then optimize it so we don’t have to think about it. Hardware That Guy This Guy Everyone knows that major search engines run on commodity hardware. Why should developers need a better dev box than what one of the most sophisticated pieces of software on the planet needs? 4 Cores? 1 Core is more than enough. 32GB of RAM? When I was a dev I got by just fine with 2GBs. SSDs? Faster, yeah, but expensive and quiet. Every good dev needs a disc spinning in the background. Monitors? One 15 inch was fine for me 10 years ago and it’s more than enough pixels for today. Visual Studio takes up more screen real estate now, so that’s why the good people at Microsoft put scrollbars in there. Plus, we are using Visual Studio 2005…that version only has 42 context menu items – yes they go off the screen, but that’s what the keyboard arrow keys are for. Mice? Keyboards? Good devs don’t need them. Period. Everything that can be done with a keyboard and mouse can be done faster in the command prompt. Do not buy them Blync lights. It’s just one more thing you’ll have to ignore. Invest in good hardware. Devs love working with reliable hardware. Crappy hardware gets in the way of what they love to do. I’m not saying buy everyone a 4k monitor, but make sure they have a super fast machine.I just got everyone on my team new SSDs so VS loads faster and local build time is reduced. Everyone has at least 2 24&quot; monitors, Microsoft Sculpt keyboards and fast dev machines. I just placed an order for a couple of “3.7ghz, 6 Core, 32GB, 256 SSD, 1TB HDD, 8 video 4k output” machines. Process That Guy This Guy Developers like to live in silos, which is why they like waterfall. What they really like is a lot of planning, usually around 6-9 months, and then coding for about 1-2 weeks and then feature cuts or project cancellations and then more planning. Agile? I love agile. I mean the team is saying that anyone can come at any time and request anything and they will accommodate it? Perfect. Standups? No. Devs should be sitting and coding and not talking. People will know when their stuff is done because they can hear them yell “compiling!” from down the hall. Discourage pair programming. You are the one paying them to code, not to be buddies. You definitely don’t want two people working on something that one person could do alone. Plus, you have the added benefit of discovering that those two devs actually developed the same thing independently and then have to wrestle over which implementation is better. There’s nothing like a good unnecessary heated debate to boost productivity. Whether you like it or not, your developers will use agile. As I mentioned before we are very efficient humans. We optimize. We start a lot of things, but also know when to stop them when they are failing. Why not embrace agile and be a strong advocate for it? That will definitely motivate your devs to come up with new ways of doing things that help them be more productive. Support their ideas. Try anything once. Agile doesn’t mean you just adopt Scrum or you do a standup. It’s a cultural shift that embraces iteration and constant feedback. You have to be okay with uncertainty, but by doing so leads to team to productivity. Quality That Guy This Guy TIP (Testing In Production) is cool, but TIP-WAU (Testing In Production With Actual Users) is even cooler. If you want to know where the bugs are in your software then just ship it. Users will report any bugs. That way you don’t need to distract developers from what they do best…creating new features. Those new features may break other features, but as long as the new feature somewhat works it’s all good. There’s this popular concept that “good enough” is better than “perfect”. I like to take that a step further and say “Compiling? Ship it!”. Hit F5. Build Succeeded? Ship. Don’t think, don’t test it, just ship it. Devs like to ship. Give them that opportunity. Since devs should be working on new features, they don’t really have time to be writing unit tests. If they wrote the code right the first time then unit tests aren’t really necessary. What has worked for me is just happy-path testing every other release when they have time, which is never, because they are coding new features. Most features get cut anyway, so the chance of them ever being seen by a customer is slim to none. This is a transitional year for Microsoft. We are moving from a 4 team setup (Dev, Test, PM &amp; Ops) to two team setup (Dev and PM). The Test and Ops roles are merging with the Dev discipline. We inherited a lot of responsibility and are working through it. My team is investing heavily in test automation. From unit tests to end-to-end test to performance. We are coming up with a solution that allows us to build functional and end-to-end tests upon unit tests. The idea is to optimize testing and get it as close to the code as possible. There’s no way we can ship as fast as we’d like to without automation. Fixing this means better quality releases and more time focused on making sweeping changes that were too risky before automation. Rewards That Guy This Guy Devs are already really well paid for what they do. Typing and thinking is not that difficult. When someone does something that deserves a reward, like when they check-in code without it getting reviewed or when they overwrite someone else’s changes or go out of their way to delete production data…that’s when you’ll be tempted to reward them, but don’t. It only leads to more ego inflation and further distraction from coding. The last thing you want is a developer walking around thinking they are valuable.Since devs are so well paid and aren’t really interested in making more money so you have to give them mundane work that anyone could do. Like fixing content bugs or updating documentation. Then when they get to code actual features they will be way more productive because they know how bad it could be. Money definitely isn’t everything, but you have to be competitive. I take a pulse on how people in the industry are paid and I think Microsoft is doing well. Especially if you consider the entire compensation package. I stand behind my theory that if you do your absolute best you’ll be rewarded for it. And if not at least you know you did your best and can start thinking about places where you are better appreciated. My hope is that no one on my team feels that way. A big reward for doing something well is the opportunity to take on more challenging work. Devs love a good challenge. Small wins lead to bigger challenges and my team is usually thrilled to take them on. Fun That Guy This Guy No ping-pong. No darts. No kickball. No pool. No “wine-downs”. No “morale events”. No alcohol. No fun. No. Never. That’s what their every other Sunday is for (see “Hours” above). Fun just means time away from coding, which is what developers love to do. So, in fact, you are doing them a favor by not forcing them to pretend that they like getting to know other people. We have a dartboard, ping-pong and foosball table. We play kick-ball in the summers. We just had a ping-pong tournament. We are going to K1 racing later this month. We just saw 300. The result is that we get to know our peers, build respect and have a good time when we get back to coding. Furniture That Guy This Guy Amazon uses doors as desks and they built an empire. I coded on a 2’x2’ desk for years. If they are sitting, they shouldn’t be complaining. Some developers out there even have to use their treadmill as a desk and they aren’t complaining. Get your dev a chair, preferably a metal folding one, and they’ll be happy. Do not get them ergonomic evaluations. You only have them for a year or so; let the next manager deal with their health issues. Also, it’s best to put them in an interior facing office. Microsoft didn’t build “Windows” by looking out the window all day. Give them an office with a view and their mind will wander. Yes, by giving them time to think they might come up with a better solution, but it will take longer – and we are talking about productivity right? Microsoft in general is very good about setting people up with ergonomic workstations. We have sit-stand desks, ergonomic chairs and we have a team of ergonomists who can do one-on-one consultations with people. Devs are way more productive if they aren’t hurting. Food That Guy This Guy Joel Spolsky was wrong. Never. I mean never eat with your team. You don’t want to make them think you are one of them do you? Encourage them to bring their own lunch and eat it at their desks. If they want coffee then tell them to get instant and use the hot water from the sink. Think about loss in productivity if two of them go to get coffee at the same time and accidentally bump into each other and start talking? Devs eating alone at their desks means more code. That’s just math. We eat lunch together almost every day of the week. If not the Microsoft cafe, then one of the many restaurants around Bellevue. It’s a great way to get to know your devs and talk about non-work stuff. We often chat about software and business ideas and of course Breaking Bad. Personal That Guy This Guy Do not, I repeat, do not add your developers to Facebook. You do not want them seeing pictures of your kids and dogs. They might actually think they relate to you in some way and will want to talk about it when they see you. You don’t want them to think you are a normal person with a normal life. The last thing you want is people commenting about how cute your kid is or asking about your Mastiffs. Don’t talk about stuff they are interested in. If they like cars, then talk about hunting, if they like sports, then talk about music. Anything to divert the conversation from their interests. Under no circumstances should you ask them what their kids names are and if they tell you come up with a memory trick to immediately forget them. You might slip and say their name in the future and the developer might think you care. Which, as we know distracts from them coding. We are all pretty tight here. It’s Saturday and I just got back from bowling with my family and my co-workers family. We know the names of each other’s family and we hang out regularly. It’s like an extended family. It’s got to be organic though. Some like that, some don’t. Know when to back off. Reviews That Guy This Guy I like to take the “shock jock” approach to reviews. Like a volcano waiting to explode, I save up all my “constructive feedback” for the annual review meeting, then I just let them have it. You have to keep them guessing all the way up to the last moment. If they ask for feedback before the review, just tell them you don’t work with them day-to-day so you can’t really know how they are doing. You don’t want them thinking they are doing a great job because then they will relax, which decreases productivity. Software development is purely science. Many developers will try to convince you it’s an art, rather than a science. You should combat that with objective measurements like line of code per day, code coverage numbers and status reports. “Big data”, right? It starts with collecting data on developer productivity. Reward stuff that can be measured like number of check-ins and “hours in the office per day” and you’ll have a team that is cranking away. I have a whole post on “My Thoughts on the Microsoft Employee Review Model”. But the gist of it is that Devs need regular feedback. Good or bad. Their annual review should be a review of what you’ve been telling them for the past 12 months. No surprises. Devs are very self-critical people, but if they know they are doing well or not doing well then they’ll likely be more productive either way. Training That Guy This Guy People on my team have spent a ton of time and money on college. Everything you ever need to know was learned in college, so why should you spend your budget on training? Don’t get them Pluralsight subscriptions and definitely don’t send them to conferences. Can they code a for loop? Can they get it to compile? What more do you need to know? Time spent training is time away from coding. I just renewed my 30 Pluralsight licenses for my team. We log hundreds of hours of training each month. Many on my team go to conferences, some speak at them. I usually recommend at least 40 hours of training a year. We also have a great internal training program. I have never turned down a request for training. You have to invest in yourself. I’m just the enabler. Credit That Guy This Guy Your job as a manager is to take credit for the work that your team does. If someone has to demo what your team developed to the VP, then it should be you doing it. Make sure you mention that “I” did it…never use the word “team” and definitely don’t mention anyone on your team by name. If anyone is going to get attention it should be you and you alone. Developers don’t really care for the spotlight anyhow, so everyone wins. They get to keep coding and you get promoted. My team just did a demo for our VP on what we’ve been working on over the last 6 months. I was in the room, but my leads and architect did the talking and demos. I want their work to be recognized and I want them to be associated with it, not me. We are constantly congratulating each other on our successes and are very supportive of team efforts. We are great about talking about what we have accomplished and who helped us along the way. Vision That Guy This Guy Visions are overrated. You want to keep them guessing about what you are thinking. Don’t come out and say you don’t have a vision. Keep talking about how you are working on the vision and how you will “reveal it soon”. Encourage them to be tactical, focus on today and let you handle the future. If you have a vision, then your team starts to think you have their back and will want to stick around on your team. Or they could see the vision, not agree with it and leave. Either way it’s a lose-lose situation. People are attracted to what they can clearly see, so make the future as fuzzy as possible so they gravitate towards coding for today and then surprise them at the last possible moment. Developers like to go deep, but everyone once and a while they like to peek into the future and see if they’ll be interested in where the team or product is going. You don’t want to shove it down their throats, but it is the manager’s job to have the vision ready for them when they need it. They have amazing insight into future potential for the product they are working on and they should be deeply involved in shaping its future. Having that view into what is coming helps them either rest and focus makes them nervous because they see you don’t know what you are doing. Make sure it’s the former. Closing Thoughts If your goal is to ship at all costs, then the price you’ll pay will be counted in the number of developers who have left your team. I believe that a happy dev team is more productive. The second you realize that every single one of your developers could be doing something else with their time, you don’t take them for granted. They won’t turn down more money, but money isn’t the be all and end all for developers. They want fun, interesting, challenging and meaningful work. It’s up to managers to set the team up for success by finding out what makes them tick and doing everything they can to remove obstacles. Some of these obstacles are imposed by you the manager. Not fostering training hinders progress. Not caring about quality crushes motivation. Not rewarding leads to disenfranchisement. You can start helping with dev productivity by taking baby steps. Hear from you team about what makes them tick. Prioritize, execute and repeat.

All of my interests have one thing in common - they all take lots of time and energy to perfect. Want to make a perfect espresso drink? Want to take the perfect photo? Want to compose a great song? Want to build robust software? Everything takes so much time, which I’m finding I have less and less of. There are so many variables with all of my interests. There is literally endless amounts of tweaking to be done. There’s a lot of intrigue in knowing that the smallest tweak can dramatically change the outcome and when you find that perfect mix…it’s an incredible high. With espresso, the beans have to be fresh, the dose has to be exactly right, the grind has to be not too fine and not too coarse, the tamp has to be around 25lbs of pressure, you have to time the shot perfectly so you don’t get too much blonde espresso and don’t get me started about latte art. With photography, everything from the body, lens, shutter speed, aperture, ISO, framing, post-production, soft-proofing, color profiles, color balance, printer. With music…oh man…the variables are endless. My problem is that I obsess about whatever I’m doing and that ends up consuming my entire being. Just recently I drank 8 shots of espresso within a 20 minute period while I was trying to perfect my shots. While in college I seriously hurt my arms because I was playing to much bass…up to 8 hours a day. I was in Korea a couple of years ago and I took so many photos that my neck locked up and I was unable to move for 4 days. My struggle has always been trying to balance all my interests. I love my job as a dev manager and I love working for Microsoft. I get to work with awesome people, awesome software and I thoroughly enjoy the work. I like taking something that is broken – software, process, people – and fixing it. I’m a cleaner – sort of speak. But, being a dev manager only satisfies a small portion of my interests. I’ve tried to beef up the coffee situation at work and I’ve brought my guitar in on occasion, but it’s not enough. I’ve had this yearning to explore other options for my career and I’m happy to say I have found the perfect thing for me in this season of my life. When I setout to find that perfect thing I wanted it to involve as many of my interests as possible. I’ve been doing software for 15 years, so I could give or take that aspect of my interests. What I really love about in software is the people. I love being a manager. I also wanted to find something that involves espresso, music and photography. It has been tremendously difficult finding something that let me mix them all together. But, I did. I was at a party over the holiday break and a friend of a friend that works at Starbucks was there and we chatted it up for a bit. It turns out we have all the same interests. He was telling me that as a barista manager at Starbucks he’s able to help people grow from entry-level baristas to barista leaders and a lot of his job is mentoring, encouraging and directing the store. Management? Check. Espresso. Check. Then he started tell me about their Friday night live music sessions and that he often sits in with the band. They mostly play the classics, but with a neo-jazz take. Music? Check. He also mentioned that he takes photos of the bands that play and of course takes photos of all the great latte art as they hit the counter. Photography? Check. Howard Schultz is now taking great coffee seriously and needs a team of people on the ground that believe in the same mission. I know it’s not perfect and I know I will miss software, but at this season in my life I’m convinced that being a Starbucks Barista Manager provides the best of all the worlds of my interest. So as of today, April 1st. I will hang up my IDE and put on my green apron as very proud and determined-to-succeed Starbucks Barista Manager!!! I’m sure many other developers out there want to know how I came to this conclusion. But, I just decided to follow what my gut was telling me and take a chance on my dreams. Let me know if you want to chat more about how you to can build up the courage to follow your dreams. Here goes nothing!

Email is a very important communication mechanism – it’s just a messaging system - a messaging system that can be easily abused. I don’t hate it – I actually send a lot of email myself – but I follow a few rules to triage them – more on that later. My priority for getting my inbox organized is to make sure I see the important mails and have brainwidth to get back to building software. I’m guessing you want the same too. I see so many people at Microsoft that don’t have a handle on their email. Some have thousands of unread emails in their inbox and tell me they just delete them every once and a while – and aren’t sure if they are missing the important ones. My process is really simple. I have a couple of artifacts (categories, rules, quick steps and folders) and a quick triage. A big part of it is about being hardcore about To, Cc and Priority. If people want me to read something they know to put me in the To line. If they want me to read it ASAP they make it High Priority. If they put me in the Cc line there’s a good chance it will take me a week or so to respond. This process isn’t going to work for everyone - my boss has a folder for every person and that works for him – but if you are stressing about your email, then the following might be a good start for you. Let me know how it turns out and feel free to leave comments with any modifications or other tips. THE ARTIFACTS CATEGORIES Followup - Items that need to be checked on occasionally. P1 - Items that need to be acted upon before P2 P2 - Items that need to be acted upon after P1 items are complete. FOLDERS Inbox - I’m in To and High Importance or from someone in bypass list. A - I’m in To B - I’m in Cc C - Everything else Keep - Emails that I need to refer to every once and a while. Cost Center Codes, etc Processed - This is a holding place for emails that have been processed, i.e. moved from Inbox, A, B, or C. All mail eventually ends up in this folder. RULES Delete Subject - Deletes mail with specific words in Subject. Build mails that I don’t care about, stuff like that. Delete To - Deletes mail sent to certain people or groups - I’m on some aliases and adding the DG to this rule is faster than figuring out how to remove myself from the DG. Delete From - Deletes mail from certain people or groups - Some people or groups I just have to ignore - internal spam or the like. Self Flag - I occasionally send email from my phone to myself as a reminder to do something. This rule just flags mail that are sent me and are from me. I assign the categories later when I’m at my desk. Follow Up - Adds the “Followup” category to the item if it’s from me and I’m in the Cc. I occasionally Cc myself on emails I send as a reminder to follow up. Bypass Rules - This rule bypass all the following rules so that the item stays in my inbox. I use this rule for email from my boss all the way up to the CEO and a few peers that I want to make sure I see all their mails. To High - Checks if I’m in the To and it’s High Importance and keeps in Inbox. To - Checks if I’m in To and moves to “A” folder Cc - Checks if I’m in Cc and moves to “B” folder Other - If the item got past all the above rules then move it to the “C” folder. QUICK STEPS Outlook has a “Quick Steps” feature that allows you to automate basic tasks like flagging and moving mail. As you will see below I use them to quickly process incoming mail. Noop (CTRL+SHIFT+1) – No action required, just moves the selected items to the Processed folder. P1 (CTRL+SHIFT+2) – Moves the selected items to the Processed folder, Flags it and add to the P1 Category. P2 (CTRL+SHIFT+3) – Moves the selected items to the Processed folder, Flags it and add to the P2 Category. Followup (CTRL+SHIFT+4)– Moves the selected items to the Processed folder, Flags it and add to the Followup Category. I use CTRL+SHIFT+1 for Noop instead of P1 because that’s the combination I use 80% of the time. I just works better for me ergonomically. I forgot about the underlying keys long ago. TRIAGE STEP 1 – TRIAGE MAIL Check Inbox – Because I setup the Rules above, I know that if something is in still in my Inbox then it is something I should deal with asap. Check A every once and a while, check B once a day and check C once a week. I use my Quick Steps heavily during the triage process. I use my thumb to hold down the CTRL and SHIFT keys a the same time and then use my index finger to press the 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys. Using Quick Steps I can get through a ton of items in minutes. I usually select a bunch of items or whole conversations and process them all at once. I also have Inbox and A sync’d to my phone, but only go through the triage process on my desktop. STEP 2 – GO THROUGH FLAGGED ITEMS Categorize items that don’t have a category assigned (these are “clean up DGs” and “peer feedback” in the screenshot). These are usually manually entered tasks or emails that I sent to myself (see Self Flag rule above) Check P1 (I collapsed the P1 category in my screen shot because there are a few confidential items in there at the moment). Items in this category should be either completed by the end of the day or moved to P2. Check P2. These items are usually important, but not urgent. Check Followup. These items are on my radar – usually things I ask other people to do. See my “Follow Up” rule above to see how things get in this category. STEP 3 – GET BACK TO BUILDING The whole point of having an email process is to get email out of the way so you can get to the things that you love to do. You are now free from the nagging in the back of your mind and you can get into the zone. And remember that you own your time. If someone wants to reach you they know where you sit, they have your number and you’re probably on IM. Hope this helps. Feel free to let me know if you think there are ways I can improve this. As I’m always looking for ways to trim the noise.

I bought an Apple Airport Extreme 5th Gen Router back in May 2012. I get very fast (100mbps) internet at my house and the Airport Extreme is the only router that consistently gets around 94mbps over the air. It’s okay to be jealous. It worked great for about a year and then it started disconnecting ever 20 minutes or so. I tried everything from downgrading the firmware to factory reset to hardwiring…nothing helped. I went to BestBuy (where I bought it) and they said there’s nothing they can do because it was out of the 1 year warranty. They couldn’t do a trade-in because it wasn’t functioning properly. They were cool about it, but told me to take it to Apple. So, as a last ditch effort I made a Genius Bar appointment. They also said there’s not much they can do. They offered to sell me a new one for $152 or I could buy the latest model for $199. I was bummed because I just dropped about $200 on it a year ago. Here’s how the conversation continued: Me: &quot;Is there any way I could maybe talk to a manager or someone who can get creative on how to maybe give me a credit for my router in exchange for a new one? I mean, I just dropped $200 and I really did expect it to last longer than a year.&quot; Genius: “Sure man, you can definitely talk with a manager, let me go explain the situation to him and I’ll be right back” — Wait 5 minutes — Manager: &quot;Hey man, so I totally understand your situation&quot; Me: &quot;Yeah, it’s an interesting situation because I love this router, it just disconnects all the time. I dropped $200 a little over a year ago and I expected it to last longer. The Genius said he never sees these routers come back, so I’m thinking it might be a defective one. It would awesome if you could pull a few strings for me.&quot; Manager: &quot;Sure, I’d be willing to split the difference with you. I want you to leave here feeling like you got what you wanted and I want you to be happy with your experience. How does that sound? How about I cover $100 and you pay the remaining $100 on a new one?&quot; Me: &quot;Absolutely, that would make me extremely happy! Thank you so much&quot; Manager: &quot;You know what is also cool, is that we just had a decent conversation. Most people come in here and demand a free replacement and get very hostile. I appreciate you being cool about it.&quot; Me: &quot;Definitely man, I really appreciate you meeting me half way.&quot;I grabbed my new 6th Gen AirPort Extreme and was on my merry way. Kudos to Apple. The Genius was super cool by not taking offense to me wanting to talk with a manager and the Manager was cool for meeting me half way on the price and treating me very well. Maybe some people would have wanted to get a free replacement – I would have taken it, but I didn’t expect it. It was over the 1 year warranty and I chose not to purchase the Geek Squad warranty and Apple Care. I was at the mercy of the Genius and the Manager, so I gladly accepted the offer. They also let me keep the old router – which is cool, because maybe the issue will go away with a future firmware update. I’m very pleased with my new router and very impressed with how Apple handled the situation.

If unchecked I would sit, eat and code all day. Even a little motivation does wonders for my psyche. I use a bunch of apps to keep me motivated with yoga, weight tracking, pushups and running. This post is about my experiment with the latest step counters. The Back Story Back in August I tried the Fitbit Flex and Jawbone UP – I preferred the UP, but I wasn’t completely happy with either of them. I didn’t like the Flex because Fitbit sleep data wasn’t as rich as the UP and I didn’t like the UP because I had to plug it in to sync it. I concluded that experiment wanting the UP with Bluetooth, but it didn’t exist back then. I ended up just using the Argus app. Argus is an iPhone app that runs in the background and counts your steps. It also captures everything that the Fitbit and UP apps capture like activities, weight, food and calories. But my iPhone battery was constantly draining – I could watch the battery percentage decrease by 1% every minute. I thought it was Argus’s fault, so I uninstalled it. Then Jawbone released the Jawbone UP24 – which includes Bluetooth sync. I figured I would try it out – because my analysis in August led me to wanting an UP with Bluetooth. I thought it would be perfect. I bought a Large. The first thing I noticed is that it’s really big for my wrist. It slips up and down my arm and I’m constantly moving it around. I get a small piece of velcro and stick it to the insides of the UP24, but the velcro glue doesn’t hold up. The UP24 was getting caught on my coat and shirt and I feared losing it. I go back to the store and get an UP24 Medium – but it’s too tight – it feels like it’s cutting off blood flow to my hand. It took me a while to realize it, but the UP24 actually feels like a rubber-coated handcuff. Whichever I choose it has to be comfortable. It’s going to be on my wrist 24x7 and it can’t annoy me. So, now I’m back to square one. The UP24 Large is too big. The UP24 Medium is too small. I go back to the store and pick up a Fitbit Flex again. The sleep data still isn’t as rich, but if comfort is my first priority then the Flex wins. I wear the Jawbone UP24 and the Flex 24x7 for two weeks straight. I did a couple of simple accuracy tests to see which one is better and the UP24 is definitely more accurate. The Fitbit was always about 12% low. But that wasn’t a strong enough case to go with the UP24. During that two week period I had had enough with my iPhone battery and stopped by the Genius Bar. It turns out my battery was defective. They swapped it out in 15 mins. It then dawned on my that my previous battery issues weren’t Argus’s fault. I installed Argus again and started tracking my activity with all three: UP24, Flex and Argus. After a week I ruled out the UP24. The velcro I put on to hold it in place kept coming off, I was anxious about losing it, I felt it there constantly and I couldn’t get the rubber handcuff association out of my head. Then a few days ago the Flex started bothering me. My hands started to feel swollen – even when the band was very loose – and I started taking it off at night because it bothered me so much. I’ve only used Argus for the past week, so it might be too soon to tell, but I’m loving it. I’m really getting into what I call unobtrusive quantification – which basically means capturing data without being intentional about it. The end result of my analysis is that I’m not going to use any of the fitness bands. I want to see how far I can go with measuring without having an extra device on me. I always have my phone on me – so it should work out well. I’ll update this post later on if anything changes. Hope this helps you figure out which one to go with. Try out Argus first and see if that meets your needs. Jon p.s. I didn’t throw the Fitbit Force into the mix because I consider the Flex to be UP24’s main competitor. The Force is in a different category in my opinion. UPDATE 1/12/2014: I do not recommend Argus for iPhone 5. It prevents your phone from going into standby mode, which reduces the battery life by a significant amount. Mine would die after about 4 hours of normal usage. I have since upgraded to iPhone 5S. Argus works fine and I have normal battery life. You don’t have to actively run Argus because of the iPhone 5S motion tracker feature. My Observations Fitbit Flex Jawbone UP24[![onyx.v2 (1) Argus **Price** $100 $150 Free **Size** Comes with small and large bands that are adjustable. You can adjust the Flex to fit your wrist. I like how I can change the size based on use. Loose when I'm in bed, tighter during the day. Comes in small, medium and large sizes that aren't adjustable. You get what you get with the UP. I found the medium to be too small and the large to be too big. N/A. It's an app. **Bluetooth Sync** Real time syncing. You can see your step count go up as you walk. Syncs every 1 minute when the app is open or every 20 minutes if the app is closed. I found the sync to be flaky. I have little confidence that the displayed step count is the actual step count. I find myself looking at the app for about a minute just to make sure it is in sync. Jawbone told me they are working on improving sync. N/A. Real time measurement. **Website** [Fitbit.com](http://fitbit.com/) - online dashboard where you can view all of your data. Unoffical website here: [upinterface.com](http://www.upinterface.com/) None **Mobile App** Basic grid app. Nothing special. iPhone, Android and unofficial [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/fitbit-tracker/af1e2d65-5004-449b-a967-ac7c67c47493). Beautiful. This app could win design awards. The timeline view shows all your activity - astonishing compared to FitBit. No Android app. Very nice app. Honeycomb design. Automatically includes weather and detects when you start running. **Comfort** Lays flat on your wrist. Soft elastomer material. Feels like a sports watch. The clasp has traces of nickel - warning for those with nickel allergies. They do not have a nickel-free band, but they told me they are considering making one. Feels like handcuffs with a rubber coating. It gets caught on long sleeve shirts and jackets. You know when you have it on like you know you'd have handcuffs on. The UP24 plug is also coated in nickel. N/A **Band Security** Has a metal clasp that locks the band around your wrist. It takes a while to figure out how to position your finger tips to get it to lock. Wraps around your wrist, but doesn't lock. It could easily slide off, especially if it doesn't perfectly fit your wrist. Easier to put on than the Flex, but just as easy to slip off. N/A **Accuracy** I did a series of tests where I would sync both, walk and count my steps then see what each band registered as steps. All tests were done on a flat surface. Low step count. About 12% lower than actual steps. Very accurate. About 5% higher than actual steps. Very accurate. About 7% higher than actual steps – on par with UP. **Band Display** Shows your progress in the form of 5 lights. Each light lights up after you complete 20% of your goal. Doesn't show progress. N/A **Band Interface** You tap the band twice to get progress. You tap the band repeatedly for 2 seconds to put it into sleep mode. You hold down a button to put in sleep mode. You press twice for stopwatch mode and you press three times for powernap mode. N/A **Calibration** You can select which wrist you put the Flex on. Dominant or non-dominant. You use the stop watch feature to measure distance and then calibrate the band using that data. No way to calibrate from what I could find. **Stopwatch Mode** I only used this mode to calibrate. None Has the ability to track activity for a specific amount of time. None – but you can log activity in real time. **Powernap Mode** I don't take naps so I don't need this feature. None Uses your sleep data to calculate your optimal nap time. None **Battery Life** 5 days. 3 hours to charge. You have to charge for at least 10 minutes via USB before you can start using it. 7 days. 80 minutes to charge. Comes charged out of the box. It does impact iPhone battery life, but not enough to disqualify it. **Waterproof** Water resistant. Can be submerged up to 10 meters. Splash resistant. Do not submerge N/A **Alarms** Single or recurring alarms. Vibrates 3 times. You can add multiple alarms using the Sleep Alarm feature. None **Idle Alerts** None You can configure the UP to vibrate when you are inactive. None **Sleep Alarm** None You set a range of time you want to wake up and UP will vibrate when it knows you are in light sleep during that timeframe. Integrates with the [Sleep Time](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id555564825?mt=8) app. **Sleep Data** Very basic sleep data. Show you restless and asleep time. You get more data with Fitbit Premium ($49/year). Detailed sleep data. Shows you light sleep versus deep sleep and a bunch of other data points. Very rich data from Sleep Time app. **3rd Party App Integration** None Integrates with lots of apps - RunKeeper, IFTTT, MapMyFitness and others. Integrates with RunKeeper, Withings and a few others.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Reviews","slug":"Tech/Reviews","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Reviews/"}],"tags":[{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/review/"}]},{"title":"My team at Microsoft needs a Senior Front End Dev.

That allows me to reuse the crud grid functionality and have many of them on the same page. Here’s what it looks like now: CODE: https://github.com/jongio/AngularJS-WebApi-EF Here’s what I did in a nutshell: 1. Moved all the angular code to the /Scripts folder: 2. app.js only contains this one line of code to initialize the app: var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource']); 3. I put the notification factory under /Services 4. I created the crud-grid-directive.js file and put the directive code. I renamed person to object so that we can reuse the directive for multiple tables. scope: true – tells angular to create a new scope for each instance of the directive $attrs.tableName is set in the view…see how below. app.directive('crudGrid', function () &#123; return &#123; restrict: 'A', replace: false, scope: true, templateUrl: '/Scripts/App/Directives/Templates/crud-grid-directive-template.html', controller: ['$scope', '$element', '$attrs', 'crudGridDataFactory', 'notificationFactory', function ($scope, $element, $attrs, crudGridDataFactory, notificationFactory) &#123; $scope.objects = []; $scope.addMode = false; $scope.toggleAddMode = function () &#123; $scope.addMode = !$scope.addMode; &#125;; $scope.toggleEditMode = function (object) &#123; object.editMode = !object.editMode; &#125;; var successCallback = function (e, cb) &#123; notificationFactory.success(); $scope.getData(cb); &#125;; var successPostCallback = function (e) &#123; successCallback(e, function () &#123; $scope.toggleAddMode(); $scope.object = &#123;&#125;; &#125;); &#125;; var errorCallback = function (e) &#123; notificationFactory.error(e.object.Message); &#125;; $scope.addObject = function () &#123; crudGridDataFactory($attrs.tableName).save($scope.object, successPostCallback, errorCallback); &#125;; $scope.deleteObject = function (object) &#123; crudGridDataFactory($attrs.tableName).delete(&#123; id: object.Id &#125;, successCallback, errorCallback); &#125;; $scope.updateObject = function (object) &#123; crudGridDataFactory($attrs.tableName).update(&#123; id: object.Id &#125;, object, successCallback, errorCallback); &#125;; $scope.getData = function (cb) &#123; crudGridDataFactory($attrs.tableName).query(function (data) &#123; $scope.objects = data; if (cb) cb(); &#125;); &#125;; $scope.getData(); &#125;] &#125;&#125;); 5. Moved the factory code to /Directives/Services. It now accepts a type and builds the URL from that so we can reuse for multiple tables. app.factory('crudGridDataFactory', ['$http', '$resource', function ($http, $resource) &#123; return function (type) &#123; return $resource('api/' + type + '/:id', &#123; id: '@id' &#125;, &#123; 'update': &#123; method: 'PUT' &#125; &#125;, &#123; 'query': &#123; method: 'GET', isArray: false &#125; &#125;); &#125;;&#125;]); 6. As you can see in the code above I created a new template for the directive in Directives/Templates called crud-grid-directive-template.html, which contains the HTML markup that the grid will render. &lt;table class=\"crud-grid table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed table-hover\"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=\"width: 100px;\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-toolbar\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"btn icon-plus\" ng-click=\"toggleAddMode()\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=\"width: 50px;\"&gt;Id&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr ng-show=\"addMode\"&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-toolbar\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-group\"&gt; &lt;i class=\"btn icon-save\" ng-click=\"addObject()\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=\"btn icon-remove\" ng-click=\"toggleAddMode()\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;input ng-model=\"object.Name\" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"object in objects | orderBy:'Id':true\"&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-toolbar\" ng-show=\"object.editMode == null || object.editMode == false\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-group\"&gt; &lt;i class=\"btn icon-edit\" ng-click=\"toggleEditMode(object)\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=\"btn icon-trash\" ng-click=\"deleteObject(object)\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-toolbar\" ng-show=\"object.editMode == true\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"btn-group\"&gt; &lt;i class=\"btn icon-save\" ng-click=\"updateObject(object)\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=\"btn icon-remove\" ng-click=\"toggleEditMode(object)\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;span ng-show=\"object.editMode == null || object.editMode == false\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;input ng-model=\"object.Name\" ng-show=\"object.editMode == true\" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 7. Now all that is left in the view is this, which defines two crud grids and assigns the corresponding tables. &lt;h1&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div crud-grid table-name='person'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Places&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div crud-grid table-name='place'&gt;&lt;/div&gt; (I also created a new “Place” model and controller) Hope this helps you ramp up on AngularJS directives.

You actually don’t want lock shapes, you want to create layers and lock the layers. But if you really want to lock the shape then enable the Developer tab, Click Protection and check all the boxes. That turned out to be the wrong approach for me because selecting the shapes nested within locked shapes is still a pain. I ended up going with Layers. You create a layer, assign shapes to the layer and then lock the layer. Layer management in Visio is really broken from a UX perspective (as you will see below), but it’s the lesser of two evils. Let’s say you have the following shape and you want to lock the ‘background shape’ so you can move the ‘foreground shape’ Select the ‘background shape’, click the Home tab, select Layers, select Assign to Layer and call it Background To lock the layer: Home tab, Layers, select Layer Properties and check the Lock checkbox. Click ok. How do you remove a shape from the layer? Once you lock the layer then all of the shape selectors aren’t available, so there’s no way to select the shape to remove it from the layer. What you need to do is first unlock the layer, select the shape, then click Assign to Layer and uncheck Background. **How do you add another shape to the same layer? **Let’s say I want to add ‘Background shape 2’ to the background layer. You would think that you could select it, click Assign to Layer, check the Background checkbox and be done. Nope. You get this when you click Assign to Layer. Visio is broken. It doesn’t read in your current layers when you try to Assign. So what you need to do is type the name of the layer you want to add the shape to.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tech/Tutorials","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Tutorials/"}],"tags":[{"name":"howto","slug":"howto","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/howto/"},{"name":"dev","slug":"dev","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/dev/"}]},{"title":"Why I plan on switching from Spotify to Google Play Music","slug":"switch-from-spotify-to-google-play-music","date":"2013-06-10T15:33:00.000Z","updated":"2016-12-29T03:37:00.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/06/switch-from-spotify-to-google-play-music/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2013/06/switch-from-spotify-to-google-play-music/","excerpt":"","text":"Google announced that they are going to be shipping a Google Music iOS app that includes subscription music.

For example, let’s say I want to listen to Amos Lee’s album Supply and Demand. It’s easy with Google Play. Just click on “Albums” and then click on the album. With Spotify I could: 1. Search for it every time. Not practical. 2. Create a playlist for every album I’d ever want to listen to. I’d have hundreds of playlists. 3. Create a playlist for every artist I like and add all their albums to it. I’m currently doing option 3 right now – but it’s a pain.

You can still access the $http code here: https://github.com/jongio/AngularJS-WebApi-EF/tree/6b9df7c3b52caac64df800a4c8dcf8e45e0bb2d1 Here’s how I built a quick single entity CRUD grid with AngularJS, WebAPI, Entity Framework, Bootstrap, Font Awesome &amp; Toastr.

That, along with the review model and work:life balance, is a very common question I get from interview candidates and current Microsoft employees. Based on what I’ve seen over the years I don’t think you have to get into management to be a success. A lot of people go that route and later regret it because they haven’t thought through what it all means. It’s a different job that requires a different skill set that can take many years to learn. You won’t jump in and be an immediate success. There will be bumps along the way. I’m hoping this post prepares you for some of them. I’m not a Microsoft spokesperson. I’m just a dev manager sharing my thoughts. I’ve been a lead at Microsoft since 2005 and have led teams that range from 5 to 30 people on a bunch of different products. I learned a ton from the school of hard knocks and a couple of great mentors. I never took a management class before I became a lead. I was AWFUL when I first started. I cringe thinking about my early mistakes. After 8 years I feel like it is time to share some of my thoughts and help those out there struggling with the decision on whether or not they should get into management. The Career Paths At Microsoft there are two career paths: individual contributor (IC) and management. Microsoft has structured the career model to encourage both paths and doesn’t pressure people one way or the other. The level bands are: SDE, SDE II, Senior, Principal &amp; Partner. Most people start off on the IC track and are given the choice to fork off into management once they get to the Senior or Principal band. Both paths share the same level bands, but the competencies change. ICs are generally going to focus more on depth of technical knowledge and managers are going to focus more on technical breadth and collaboration. You don’t have to take the management path to be a success. There are plenty of Principal and Partner level ICs at the company. Your Path Isn’t Set In Stone Choosing the right path is hard. But the good thing is that you can go back and forth between the two paths. I know people that have gone back and forth many times throughout their career. Sometimes because they wanted to and others because they were forced to. Like I mentioned in my work:life balance post, it’s all about seasons. Sometimes you want to learn a new technical skill or go deep into something and other times you want to learn how to manage people or products. Pick the role for a season and be open to changing if it doesn’t work out or if you want a change of pace. You can fail at being a lead and pick yourself up again and go back to being an IC and vice-versa. Don’t ask yourself “What do I want to do for the rest of my career?” Instead ask yourself “What do I want to do for the next season of my career?” That could be a year or it could be 5 years. It’s up to you what you want to do. Most people, if they set their minds to it, can be fine leads. But if their heart isn’t into it or if they get into it for the wrong reasons then they will likely fail. Remember that you can always switch back and try again down the road. Don’t Worry About It Lots of people join Microsoft at the SDE or SDE II level bands. I tell them to not even worry about whether or not they should become a lead. They have many years to go before they are even allowed to be a manager. I tell them to work on being a technical leader, because all ICs need to be technical leaders anyway. Once your technical leadership skills have matured AND you are a Senior, then you can start to think about it. Otherwise don’t stress over it. Prove yourself as an IC technical leader and go from there. If you are an SDE or SDE II and have your heart set on being a lead, then discuss it with your manager and they can hopefully set you up to be in explicit technical leadership roles to give you more years of practice. I’ve done that and it has helped. Turn Around, Is Anyone There? I’ve mentored many people who want to get into management and the first question I ask is: “Is anyone following you now?” If not then they aren’t ready to be a lead. The best response I can get after I promote someone to a lead role is “Aren’t they already a lead?” That means that are already seen by the team as a leader. Sometimes I’ll ask other people on the team if they could work for the person I’m thinking about making a lead. If the answer is no, then I drill into why and get that feedback to the person who wants to be a lead. For my teams, promoting someone to a lead should be a big celebration that most of the team supports. If the majority of the team doesn’t think the person should be a lead then it is going to be a very hard uphill battle for them and for me. I’d rather push the promotion out a bit and let the person mature before pulling the trigger. Ask Yourself “Why?” Why do you want to be a lead? Is it because you think that is what you need to do to get ahead. Wrong. Is it because you want to have a bunch of mini-mes that can implement all your ideas? Wrong motive. Is it because you want to mentor, encourage and support a team to help them reach their full potential? Getting closer. Decide to be a lead because you think you’d love it and you’d serve yourself and your company better for doing so. It’s Not A Popularity Contest Do you have to be the most-liked person in the room? If so, then you’ll struggle as a lead. Sometimes you will do things that you know are right that will make you unpopular with some folks. Those situations should be addressed with open, honest and respectful communication, but they will come up. Prepare yourself for some awkward situations where you aren’t the most popular person in the room. It’s okay. It will pass and hopefully whatever made you unpopular will turn into a very big plus later down the road when it all works out as you had hoped. Use Your Strengths Are you good at going into a deep hole for 14 hour chunks of time for weeks at a time and coming out with a masterpiece? Don’t you love that? Well, then you probably won’t be successful as a lead at Microsoft. (Probably not a good agile dev either, but that’s a different topic). I have yet to meet a lead that codes as much as they did when they were an IC. Yes, most leads still code, but it isn’t their primary focus. Do you feel like you have many good years of hard-core coding left in you? If so, then do us all a favor and don’t become a lead. There are so many other things that go into being an effective lead that if you spend days in a cave your team and the product will suffer. I’m a People Person! How are your interpersonal skills? Be honest. Do you like interacting with people? Do people like interacting with you? You will spend many hours talking with your folks as a team and individually. Some will bore you. Some will be engaging. You have to put energy and time into each relationship to figure out what makes these people tick. Sometimes you are going to just click with your folks and other times you won’t. You have to be able to carry a conversation with someone you don’t click with because they are on your team and they are looking to you for guidance. It’s tough. I’ve been there. But, I’m still here. You have to be good at recognizing when something is wrong with your folks. You have to be able to read people’s expressions, demeanor and posture to figure out if they’d like you to dig into something they aren’t saying. That’s a complex topic and I don’t have it all figured out, but it is a skill that needs to be learned. Recognize Talent Are you good at recognizing talented people? To be an effective lead you need to be interviewing for a long time before you can make a final hire/no-hire decision. You need to be bold enough to give someone a no-hire and send them home. Even after your entire team gave them a hire. The most expensive and regretful thing you can do is make a bad hire. I’ve done it. It’s painful. If you want to be a lead then get interviewing now. Get very good at asking the right questions. You will ask those questions over and over again and you’ll want to be able to distinguish a good answer from a great answer. Don’t Do It For The Money Being a lead isn’t going to make you any more money than being an IC. A Principal IC developer makes the same amount of money as a Principal Lead. As an engineer in today’s world you are already making enough money to live off of. Your motivation in life shouldn’t be to make more money it should be to do more of what you love. A potential few more dollars here and there isn’t going to change your lifestyle, but being a lead when you really want to be an IC will destroy you. Build Up To It There are a ton of management training courses out there, but none of them prepare you for real-world management. I will promote people into leadership positions, but only after they have proven to be a technical leader. I give them trial runs. I set them up for success and let them fail. They learn from the trial and, if they want to, they give it another go. A trial run may include being the feature lead on an area of the product with a couple of devs that they lead. Or it may be a new product where they are assigned a few vendors to help them. The idea is to see if they can swing it as a technical leader. Go through a couple of complete product development cycles as an IC. Feel the joy and pain of releasing software as a member of the team before you try and lead one. There are so many things to learn and then teach from time management to deployment to capacity planning to support. A lead needs to be good at them all and know how to teach the skills to their teams. Baby steps. You Aren’t Doing It Right You have an employee on your team that isn’t meeting expectations. Do you have it in you to talk to them about their performance and provide them with practical guidance on how they can improve? If not, then you aren’t ready. You can’t just tell them they aren’t doing it right. You have to give them concrete feedback with examples to back it up. You must be able to either help them get better or help them find a new job. It doesn’t happen often, but you might someday have to let someone go. Do you have what it takes to tell someone you like that they aren’t a fit for the job? My style is to give direct feedback early and often. Sometimes people don’t like it. But most of the time they do. Some of them didn’t speak with me for days because they didn’t like what I had to say. But I held my ground and let them digest the message. In every case the people come back to me, after some introspection, and thank me for the feedback and had a plan for how they are going to turn things around. The best thing you can do as a manager is give feedback to your folks. It’s tough. But essential to great leadership. And don’t save it up for a big reveal at review time. Give consistent direct feedback early and often that is both constructive and encouraging. Situational Leadership Yes, you should have your own management style. But your preferred style won’t fit every situation. Here are some good words of advice when I was just getting started: Learn to adapt your style based on the situation. In a nutshell, when given a task, people can possess or lack the necessary competence and commitment to complete it. It is up to you as a manager to figure out what the person needs in any given situation and adjust your style. Sometimes you are directing every step and other times you are encouraging and supporting. You can find out more about Situational Leadership here. There’s No Rush Don’t be in a hurry to get into management. It’s better to take your time, build a following as a technical leader, develop your style and then become an official lead. It is better to learn and develop your technical leadership chops before you have to take on people management. It’s better to do something amazing as an individual contributor to earn the respect of those around you. It’s better to enjoy where you are and be totally content with what you are doing. Jump in too early and you might get in way above your head and struggle for years. Sometimes that can be a good, but a slow ramp into management to test the waters and prove yourself has been more successful for me and the people I have promoted to leads.

The tales talked about in that book were probably correct at one point in Microsoft’s history, but I have witnessed an intentional shift to a focus on employee health and retention - which most definitely involves promotion of good work:life balance. I’m not a Microsoft spokesperson. I’m just a dev manager who has been at Microsoft since 2004 and I put family values above other priorities. The objective of this post is to give you glimpse into my view on work:life balance at Microsoft and provide you with some recommendations on things that have worked for me over the years. Other Microsofties will most definitely have completely different experiences, but I can only speak from mine. I’ve struggled with the challenge of work:life balance because I’m interested in so many things. I’ve learned to go through life in seasons and focus on a few things at a time, but it hasn’t always been that way. I don’t have it all figured out, but I thought it was worth sharing my thoughts with the hope that it helps someone that is struggling with balance or someone interested in finding out more about what life is like at Microsoft. Here’s a link to the Work:Life Balance in an “Always On” World talk I did at Ignite New Zealand: A Thousand Little Companies The first thing you need to realize is that Microsoft is like a thousand little companies - each with its own modus operandi which affects how each team looks at work:life balance. I’m not talking about the Microsoft core values like integrity, honesty, etc. Rather I’m talking about the things that set each team apart like the way people communicate with each other and what they value at a more personal level. The work:life balance gauge for each team largely depends on the product the team is building and even more so on the team leaders. If they are working non-stop, which is unfortunately normal at Microsoft, then some of the people down the chain will do the same at all costs to be noticed. Choose early in your career to not chase after that. Competitive Product or Healthy Work:Life Balance? Most people think that you can either work on a competitive product or have work:life balance, but two things don’t have to be mutually exclusive. I’ve worked on many cool products all-the-while maintaining a good healthy balance, because I was intentional about how I managed my time. Some people think you have to work non-stop for long periods of time, but that doesn’t work these days. Maybe it did the early days, but (I think) we are much smarter about how software is built and can achieve much better results with a healthy self-directed team. Most teams at Microsoft have external competition, Bing, Xbox, etc - so it is understandable that those teams work longer hours and are under more stress than other teams. Think about that when you decide which team to work for. External competition means a lot of challenging work, but your balance may suffer. Internal work can be challenging, but it’s a different kind of challenge that might offer better work:life balance. I know that everyone is different and we all go through seasons. Sometimes you may want to double down for 6 months to be part of an amazing product and sometimes you want to lay-low so you can coach your kid’s soccer team 3 days a week. The important thing is figuring out what matters to you for a given season and finding a way to make it work for everyone in your life. Values Aligned? Do your personal values align with the values of the team? This can be a hard one to get a straight answer on while interviewing, but you can ask smart questions that lead you to the answer. Of course they will tell you they are all about balance when you are interviewing. But what happens when it’s crunch time? Does everyone freak out or do they have a solid leader that keep things together so everyone doesn’t burn out? Work Long Hours or Results? Does this team value working non-stop or are they about results? Ask the leader and other team members what hours they work. I interviewed once and I asked that question. The response was…“I work 8 hours in the office and then I go home and work another 8…I have two jobs.” Red flag. Run away. I didn’t run at the time and regret it. Free Dinner? Does this team order free dinner every night? I know this is great at Google because you never have to leave, but it’s a bad sign at Microsoft. Some teams provide dinner every night……sounds like a dream come true for a guy right out of college, but for a guy with kids that can be a nightmare. That means they are expecting everyone to work through dinner. Precious family time for me. Hard and Smart? Is the team engaged and is everyone working hard and smart? A disengaged team leads to poor work:life balance. They don’t think far enough ahead to plan for hard times and end up pushing everyone in a “death march”. Are the people on the team excited about what they are doing and are they doing the right things? Flame Mails Are people sending flame mails? You can tell if a team is healthy by asking when the last time there was a serious flame mail. That is what we call emails that intend to hurt other people and are usually escalated to HR. It hasn’t happened on any of my teams in a long time and maybe it doesn’t happen anymore, but it doesn’t hurt to ask if they still go on. If they do then you might want to consider a different job. Replaceable? There are important things in life and then there are VERY important things in life. Make sure you are good in the areas of life that you aren’t easily replaceable (family) and then focus on the other areas (work). I’m not saying don’t care about work. I’m saying care about the VERY important things more. If your work:life balance is off and the VERY important things are threatened, then take a break and get some help. At work you can be replaced in about 5 minutes, but you are effectively irreplaceable at home. Keep that in mind. I think about it every day. Using Paid Time Off? Microsoft gives me 4 weeks vacation, 2 weeks sick time and 10 holidays a year. That’s 2 months off a year and I use it all. I use vacation time to get out of town and disconnect for long periods of time and I sometimes use sick time when I need to recharge physically or mentally. The job is taxing and the time off allows you to get back to a place where you can put 100% in. You are only allowed to roll over a max of what vacation time you can earn in a year. If you get 3 weeks a year then you can only roll over 3 weeks. The worst thing you can do is not use it and lose it. To me that’s just throwing away time, which is money. Use your paid time off. It is an essential part of the work:life balance equation. Results You, your manager and your team should put results above all other things. Pay attention to the output of each team member and the team as a whole. Is it extraordinary? If not, then the answer usually isn’t work more hours. The answer can be many things, but it’s probably the leader’s fault. The team needs direction and (sometimes) organization - yes, self-directed and self-organizing teams are the best, but Microsoft is a mixed bag and sometimes you need to show them the way until they get it on their own. They need the leader to set clear goals and expectations for each of them and for the team as a whole. Sometimes it helps for the leader to literally draw out the dots and let them connect them. It’s good to call out the guy who sweeps in at the last moment and saves the day, but make sure you are also rewarding the team for continued results. No Good Burned Out Talk to any of the people that have been on my teams in the last 5 years or so and they will remember me saying that they are “no good to me burned out”. You cannot be effective if you are burned out. After a certain amount of hours your productivity decreases over time. I’d rather have a developer put in 4 hours of focused engineering work a day than 10 hours of random stuff to make them look busy. I have a friend that translates from Korean to English for a living and gets paid by the word. After many years of translating he discovered that he reaches his max words-per-minute ratio after 30 minutes. If he continues to work after that first 30 minutes then he starts to lose money. So he works in 30 minute bursts with 5-10 minute breaks in between. Figure out what your cadence is and stick with it. If you are a dev then it probably isn’t 30 minutes, the number doesn’t matter. Just recognize when you start to become less productive and do something else for a while. Go home early. Take a walk. Talk to a co-worker. Play ping-pong. Whatever. Just don’t sit there and plow through it. Work Hours It would be great if Microsoft was a Results Only Work Environment (ROWE), but it’s not…yet. I’m working on getting it there, but for now I’m very flexible when it comes to work hours. I ask my folks to show up for standup, go to important meetings, be available via IM/Phone between 10am-2pm and the rest is yours to figure out. I personally work from 4am-7am, then 10am-5pm. That allows me to eat breakfast and dinner with my family every day and be available in the evenings for homework, games, play, puzzles, etc. I’m content with putting that much time into my primary income source and my family is happy with the balance, so it’s a win-win. Take the time to figure out what works for you, your team and your family. Establishing that cadence is key to a healthy work:life balance. Block Your Calendar I block two very important times in the day: 12-1pm and 3-5pm. I want to eat lunch with my team as much as possible, because I’ve been working with these people for so long and I really like hanging out and talking shop. It doesn’t happen often, but people book lunch meetings for random stuff that isn’t important. Lunch with the team is usually more important. I also block 3-5pm, so I can make sure I have time to close out any loose ends for the day and go home with a clear head. You obviously don’t have to block those exact hours, but block some time during the day so people can’t book meetings and you can do whatever it is you need to do. I know some people that block whole afternoons so they can get a good chunk of focused coding done and I know other people that block whole days, crawl into their cave and come out with a ton of work. Whatever works for you. Just make sure you own your calendar and you have focused time to get your engineering work done without distraction. Weekends Are Sacred I’ve been a lead at Microsoft since 2005 and I have only asked my teams to come in on a Saturday twice since then. Both were for major public facing releases and there were bugs that had to be resolved. Twice in eight years! That’s really low compared to other teams and companies that work non-stop nights and weekends. I just can’t bring myself to do that. Well, maybe for a season, but I haven’t been in that situation for a real long time and I haven’t been on a “death march” in a long time either. Maybe I’ve been sheltered, maybe I’ve found a better way, either way I’m fine with the way it is. Weekends are for family IMO. Always Answer The Phone If my family calls I drop whatever I’m doing and answer the phone. If I’m busy then I ask if it is an emergency. If not, I call back. If so, I’m ready to jump into action. I don’t want to be the guy in a meeting not answering a call from my wife when she is stuck on the side of the road or got into an accident or whatever. Nothing that you are doing at work is more important than what your family is calling about. You may say, yeah, but my family calls every 5 minutes with stupid random stuff. I would have a conversation with them and establish a boundaries around certain hours. Disconnect At Home Don’t be the guy that is constantly checking his phone or constantly getting the new mail ring tone while spending time with your family. They notice that you aren’t focused on them and it’s disrespectful. Again, whatever it is can wait…unless you are on live site support and you are losing millions of dollars by the second. Figure out what works and set expectations with your family. Hopefully you aren’t in that mode constantly. If so, then you probably want to find a different job. Have “Whatever Time” As I mentioned before, I work from 4am-7am. I know not everyone can get up that early and I have no idea why I do, but those hours are precious. I call it my “whatever time”. That means I get any high priority issues out of the way and then I do whatever I want. Sometimes it is burning down the backlog, sometimes it is researching tech or taking a PluralSight course. Sometimes I go for a run, sometimes I play guitar. It all depends on what I feel like doing that day and I give myself the freedom to figure out what I want to do and not feel guilty about it. Microsoft gets plenty of my hours during the week. In general this is work time, but it can also be anything I want. Set aside some time in the day to do whatever you want. If that is spending more time with your family at night than that is fine, just make sure you making the decision, not the company you work for. Own Your Priorities I have a doc that lists all my priorities in ascending order. I revisit the doc every morning and ask myself a few questions about each of them. Is there anything that your wife has asked you to do that you haven’t done? Is there anything you need to take care of for your family? Are all your high priority tasks taken care of for your number one income provider? I go down the list and mentally check-off the items. It’s a great way to be reminded of the things that are important to you and make sure you aren’t slacking on any of them. Your priorities can be whatever you want them to be. I find it helpful to write them down and review them regularly because I so easily get off track with frivolous unimportant things. They Will Only Get As Much As You Give There is a never-ending-ever-increasing amount of work that needs to be done. You could work non-stop for the rest of your life and there would still be more work. If you let them, Microsoft (or any company), will accept as much work as you want to give. It is up to you to draw the line and say when you’ve done enough. Feel good about what you have done and set a boundary between what is healthy. They will work you to the bone if you let them. Don’t let them. You Can Work As Much As You Want As a manager I’m never going to tell someone that they can’t work more than 40 hours a week. By the time someone gets to my team they are adults and can manage their own life. I may drop some hints here and there and will intervene if it gets really bad, but most of the time I let them figure it out on their own. I’ve heard stories of managers who track their folk’s time and cut them off after a certain amount of hours. Don’t be that guy. Don’t coddle. If your people want to work all the time then let them have their moment. Don’t stifle. Be Flexible A lot of the advice above is in general terms and is dependent on a lot of factors. I tell people that in the corporate world they should account on doing work they love about 80% of the time and work they don’t love 20% of the time. That is the ideal for me. Sometimes you are paid to do something you don’t like. That’s life…to a certain extent. It is up to you to figure out how much work you don’t love you can handle. Other times you’ll be asked to work (or want to work) extra because you don’t want to leave it for another co-worker or are excited about it. Set up a communication system with the people you work with and your family to accommodate those situations. I’ll sometimes tell my family: “I’m going to go work something out for another hour tonight and then you’ll have my full attention.” I have a very understanding wife, partly because she’s in software as well, but hopefully your relationship is grounded enough that your significant other understands how creative/software people can be. Mine knows that, if I ask, then it is important to me and knows that I won’t be able to stop thinking about it anyway, so it’s not a big deal that I wrap something up. Those instances are rare, but the point is to be flexible enough to allow anomalies from your balance to come in. Sometimes you’ll leave work early to see the doctor or watch a movie and sometimes you’ll need to stay a bit to wrap something up. Be flexible. Own It I firmly believe that work:life balance is up to you…not your employer. Don’t let a manager or a company control your life. If you want to cut out early to see your kid play ball or whatever, then do it and don’t feel guilty about it. I repeat…don’t feel guilty about enjoying your life. The ultimate goal is a healthy work:life balance and that includes being guilt free when you do the things you love to do. Figure out what is important to you. Be firm. Take control of your work:life balance and live happily. Jon p.s. I’ve been working on this post for a couple of weeks and just yesterday I got a call from my wife at 3:30. Her car wouldn’t start. I was in a meeting, but I answered the phone. I called a tow truck and made sure she was good. I then got home and told her I needed some time to wrap a few things up for work – which was totally fine. Special thanks to James Trott and John Kurlak (devs that have worked for me in the past) for reviewing this post and providing great feedback.

I don’t hate it and I don’t love it. I personally tend to not stress about things I can’t change. I’m more passive than others when it comes to these types of things because I’d rather spend my energy on engineering work. The bottom line is that an engineer shouldn’t have to worry about the review model. Idealistic? Yep, but, as you will read below, there are some things you can do to set yourself up for success regardless of the current review model. When people ask me what I think of the review model, I usually start by flippantly asking “You got a better way to review 100k people?”, we laugh and then I get into what I really think. I’ve tried my best to summarize it all below and I might come back later to add more. Follow me on twitter if you want to get the updates. I’ve been at Microsoft as an FTE since 2004 and since then the review model has changed 3-4 times. Actually when I joined it was good to get a “5” and bad to get a “1”. Now it is the opposite. I’ve been a lead since 2005 and have had to learn these new models, teach my people about what it all means and hand out the reviews. 99% of the time it is a great experience because I’ve been fortunate enough to be on very high performing teams and I’m a strong believer in “no surprises”. Meaning that all my people know how they are doing (good or bad) long before the mid-year and annual reviews. Like I said earlier, you shouldn’t have to worry about it and here’s how I think you can minimize the stress around it. Do Amazing Work It all starts with what you produce or how you are adding value. The first thing we look at when talking through our people is the “what”. It’s less about checking off boxes and more about the big fish that you fried. If you aren’t doing your absolute best and churning out a bunch of engineering work then you should be honest with yourself and be okay getting an average review. Take a look around at all the work people of the same level are doing. How do you compare? If you take a few minutes and think about it you could probably do more, but it’s not about doing more. It’s about doing what is right and what is needed. That comes with time, so don’t worry if you are at a stage in your career where you don’t know what is right. Observe others around you, preferably more senior people, and do what they do. It’s more than checking in code. Review others code. Influence designs. Bring new ideas. Push people to be their best. Be a technical leader. Find a Manager You Can Trust I was fortunate enough to find a manager I can trust back when I joined Microsoft as a contractor in 2003. I’ve moved around Microsoft quite a bit since then and have had a few different managers. But, there’s a reason why I’m back to working for him again today. He says what he means and means what he says. I would accept any review that he gives me because there is a level of trust there. If he thinks that I’m doing an average job then I probably am. If you currently have a manager that you can’t trust then try to build the trust or change jobs. It’s that important. Stop here and be honest. Can you trust him? If not, then fix it. You Own Your Career I cringe when a manager says they manage someone’s career and I cringe even harder when I hear someone say their manager isn’t managing their career. It’s the person’s own responsibility to figure out what they want to do with their career and use the resources that Microsoft provides to help them get there. Managers have lives too and they definitely can’t be spending all their time managing someone else’s career. After all, they have their own career to manage. A truly good manager provides help, guidance and support towards their direct reports career aspirations. I will have the career discussion with my people, but it is always me asking what they want to do with their career and how I can help. Sometimes I’ll nudge people in a certain way or the other based on their strengths, but I never “manage” their career and you shouldn’t expect your manager to either. Your Manager Makes Review Suggestions, Not The Final Decision Your review is the result of many discussions with you, your manager, your manager’s peers, your manager’s manager, your manager’s peers and eventually all the way up to Ballmer. Every one of those people have a say in your review. A manager will make a recommendation for your review and then you are discussed in relation to all your peers and a collective decision is made. If there is any contention then someone will eventually will make a call, usually the manager two levels above the people being discussed, so that would be your skip-level manager. Don’t be visible for visibilities sake, but make sure people know who you are and what you have accomplished. Your manager can help you get that visibility, but it’s best when you do such amazing work that people don’t have to promote it. The best discussions about people are the ones we skip over because everyone in the room knows the amazing work they have done and agrees with your manager’s recommendation. Be that guy. Don’t Be A Jerk I try very hard to build a team of people of the same mindset, but every now and then you end up working someone with an agenda other than collective software development. Don’t be that guy. I have a very hard time handing out a good review to someone that everyone can’t stand. There are ways to influence without being a jerk. Ask around. See if you are a jerk. Most of the time you don’t realize it. You can still be a hard-hitting-push-it-forward type engineer, just don’t leave dead bodies along the way. Track Your Accomplishments You do a lot in a year and it is hard to recall everything when it comes time to write your review. Make sure you have a way to keep track of all your successes. Some use OneNote, some use email. Whatever it is…take a weekly or monthly inventory of everything you have accomplished. Write it down and send it to your manager. When it comes time to write your review all you have to do is go back to your accomplishment log. Educate Your Manager Make sure your manager understands what you are doing and can communicate that to a room full of his peers. You are in trouble if, when it comes time to discuss your accomplishments, your manager says you “did something with some api” but you really “re-implemented your services endpoint that is consumed by the entire company to return OData endpoints on top of WebApi”. He has no idea what you did and can’t explain it. It’s not his fault. It’s yours. You haven’t educated him enough to talk intelligently about what you have accomplished. Most of the time engineers work for even more technical people, so this isn’t a problem, but if it is for you then spend some time explaining what you have done. Write it down. Send it to him. At least they’ll be able to read it to their peers. Get and Give Feedback There’s the official route through the Microsoft internal tools and then there’s the “hey, how am I doing?” informal approach. I prefer informal, but it’s good to do both. The official feedback is definitely reviewed and used when determining how someone fits into the review model. I usually over subscribe and try to get feedback from as many people as possible…even if I think the feedback won’t be glowing. It’s a great way for people to express themselves without the awkwardness of a difficult face to face conversation. Take all the feedback to heart, because the perception of how you are is as important as how you think you are. Make sure you ask your manager to see the feedback. They don’t always willingly offer it up. Getting back to the “no surprises” comment I made earlier. “Early and often” is how I like to give feedback to my team and to my peers. I don’t wait for them to ask. I don’t feel like I’m doing my job as a manager if I’m not helping people see their blind spots and encouraging them in their strengths. I have my own blind spots, every one does, and finding a person that will point them out will be HUGE for your career and personal growth. Don’t Overthink It Many people constantly nag their manager to find out how they are ranking or if they are going to get a promo. These things should be discussed, but not every week. Set aside some time to discuss with your manager and then get back to doing amazing work because without that piece there’s nothing. Don’t linger on the fact that you “only got a 2” when you think you should have gotten a better review. Honestly that’s a great number – it means that you are doing better than the majority of people at Microsoft. It might not be what you expected, but have that discussion with your manager and try to get more insight into it. Trust The System If you have all of the above in place, most importantly doing amazing work and having a manager you can trust, then you really need to let go and trust that it will all work out. Your performance will be affected if you linger on it. Use that energy to do more amazing work. Feel good about what you have accomplished and don’t depend too much on how an organization evaluates you.

I use it to scan over 400 tech blogs and often share to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and email. It’s easy to miss stuff on Facebook and there’s too much noise on Twitter. Since Google Reader is going to be retired on July 1st, I set out to find a good cloud based alternative for web and mobile. Reader Requirements Quickly Scan Headlines Since I subscribe to 400+ blogs I need a “list” interface that allows me to quickly scan headlines. I’m not interested in pictures or elaborate layouts. Google Reader was perfect for my scenario, so I’m going to try to find something as close to their layout as possible. Easily Share to Social Networks &amp; Email I often share articles that I think are interesting to Facebook, Twitter and to my team via email. I need to be able to do that from the reader interface. This is something that Google Reader is lacking in as well…you can only share to Google Plus or Email. My new service will need to be able to share to Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn and Email. Import feeds from Google Reader 400+ feeds. I’m not going to reimport them one-by-one. Fast &amp; Functional It has to to be fast and it has to work. As you’ll see later, many of the alternatives aren’t even functional. I’m sure it is because of the current onslaught of traffic, but it tells you a lot when a site can perform during these peak “Google Reader Alternative” times. Flag/Star I often see articles that I are interesting but will take more time to read than a scan. In Google Reader I star them and then go back to read them when I have a few minutes. Platforms It must work on Mac, Windows &amp; iPhone. I think the best thing for Google to do is to open source Google Reader and let another company that can scale take it over. That likely won’t happen, so let’s try to find a replacement. Google Reader Alternatives Quick Summary I grepped the entire interwebs looking for a good alternative and compared them against my requirements. All the details of my experience are below. To sum up my investigation…there isn’t a perfect replacement, but the ones that come close are: Netvibes – I’m going to switch to Netvibes. It was the only reader that met all of my requirements, performed well during the “Google Reader alternatives” peak times, but they really need to do something about that font…or let me change it. Good Noows - Met all my requirements as well, but it was extremely slow. I also really hate the popup div. I’d reconsider if they fix those issues. The following two options are included in my top 4 because they look like great apps, they just need to perform better and they need to resolve the errors. I will come back later and try them out again…or not. I’m sure I’ll get settled with Netvibes and stay there. Feedly – Looks like a great app, but too many perf issues and errors to get a good feel for it. Newsblur – Same as Feedly. I’ll come back if they improve perf and get it functional. Detailed Investigation Notes Feedly I clicked on the “Connect to Google Reader” button on the homepage… And got this… I went back to Feedly.com and it hanged on “Refreshing page…” It does look like you can view as a list… This looks like a good feature…being able to see popular articles shared by my friends and the people I follow. When I click on a tag I expect there to be a way to view all feed items that are read, but it doesn’t look like there is a way to do that. I think I’m going to like Feedly.com, but it doesn’t work right now. I’ll have to come back later to fully try it. NewsBlur I like how the content is framed into the page, but I couldn’t create an account or import from Google Reader because of this error. I’m sure it is due to load. When trying to import from Google Reader and when trying to create a new account… When trying to refresh a feed… It’s really hard to evaluate Newsblur because it isn’t functioning. Netvibes The first thing I notice is that they have a premium account for $499/month. I’m skeptical that there will be a big upsell, but I see they have a free account. The premium is for “brand monitoring” and some other stuff that I don’t really care about at this point. I click create free account and get this and select News… First thing I notice is that they do have a list layout toggle in the header: Then AWK! the font they chose is awful…no one uses Garamond, Georgia as their main font…not sure if I can look at that all day long. I click on “Add Content” and then “Add a feed”…looks like you can import from OPML (which you can get from Google Reader via Google Takeout) That redirects me to the list dashboard that looks a lot like Google Reader…but man that FONT is going to kill me. They do have a “Read Later” feature, which meets my Flag/Star requirement. I like how it is integrated into the app and doesn’t require me to use Pocket or Instapaper like Good Noows does. Clicking on “Share” opens this dialog…Facebook, Twitter and Email…no Google+ or LinkedIn So far, Netvibes is the best option because it meets all my requirements, I just wish there was a way to change the font. They don’t have LinkedIn/GooglePlus integration, but that isn’t a must have for me. Pulse I don’t see a way to view as list, couldn’t import from Google Reader moving on to next one… Flipboard Same as Pulse…moving on… Reeder Mac only. I need Windows too. Taptu I click Add Stream in top left… They have Google Reader import… I tried, but I got this spinner for about 30 mins I go back home, click Add Stream again then I see this under Reader… No way to view as list…moving on… Google Currents I don’t see a web version…moving on… Good Noows I click on Newsstand and I see OPML import… I choose my Google Reader feed and got this importing screen for at least 30 minutes… I go back to Newsstand, click on Imported sources and I see “some” of the blogs, but not all. I might have to reimport them all manually. They do have list view called: Executive Ticker You can share via Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Email…all the ones I need. In list view the titles disappear if the title is longer than the visible space: They don’t have an iPhone app and they don’t have adaptive rendering…it looks like a pain to use on iPhone Chrome. I REALLY don’t like how every story pops up in a new overlay div. The UI is awful and it is very slow. Zite Looks great, but they don’t have a web version. FeedReader No Google Reader Import. Perf is bad. Seems like a really old site. Got this when importing one site: NewsIsFree This site looks very old school. I poked around a bit and didn’t I didn’t like the usability of it and didn’t see an OPML import feature, so I moved on… Skimr They have OPML import: I waited a few minutes, went to the homepage and didn’t see any of my feeds. Although slick it doesn’t look like it meets any of my other requirements…moving on… Redefine Desktop only and it uses Adobe AIR, but I thought I’d give it a try. They have a Google Reader import feature: The reader interface looks nice, but it doesn’t meet any of my other requirements. It also appears to be backed by Google Reader, so it might not be available after Google Reader is dead. NetNewsWire Mac only. FeedDemon Will be shutdown when Google Reader dies FeedWrangler Looks promising, but not available yet. The Old Reader I get this when I try to import my Google Reader OPML HiveMinded Not released yet. Tiny Tiny RSS Looks like you have to install it on your own server. Moving on… Prismatic I don’t see a way to add new subscriptions…moving on… Rolio You can import Google Reader. Go to My Rolio –&gt; Import I initiated the import and it’s been spinning for minutes… From what I can tell there doesn’t seem to be a way to view all unread items in one list. You can click on the feeds on the right and then they pop to the top. Not going to be manageable with my 400+ feeds. You can share to social networks, but not email.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Reviews","slug":"Tech/Reviews","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Reviews/"}],"tags":[{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/review/"}]},{"title":"Windows 8 File History is great for version history, but make sure you have an alternate \"latest version restore\" plan.","slug":"windows-8-file-history-latest","date":"2013-03-12T02:40:00.000Z","updated":"2018-01-13T15:54:08.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/03/windows-8-file-history-latest/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2013/03/windows-8-file-history-latest/","excerpt":"","text":"My hard drive crashed today.

When I setup my backup strategy I was under the impression that I'd be able to go to File History and restore all files to the latest version. Unfortunately that isn't the case.

The team is in a really good place now, so it’s time to move on. Honestly, the MSN Tools team was one the most jelled teams I’ve ever been on and I was having a blast. But, I like to try new things and Microsoft is very cool about letting you do that every year or so. I started looking for my next role back in October, shortly after that I was re-org’d to the MSN.com homepage. While that put me in an awesome position…to own the MSN.com homepage, it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for. I learned a ton at MSN, like how to hire the right people, how to mentor people into becoming managers and how to run a team that gets a lot done and has fun at the same time. But, back in October I decided to try something in a different org….I just didn’t know what yet. I recently found out about an opportunity that my long time manager was diving into. No code. Brand new market and product. Windows8 Modern app. All that sounded awesome, but what really sold me was meeting the man running the team: Eric Engstrom, one of the Renegades of the Empire…. when I left that meeting I told myself that it didn’t matter what he was working on, I wanted to work with Eric. It’s not to often that you find someone with so much passion and innovation and the know-how to execute on it. I’m pumped about the project, but I’m equally pumped about what I will learn from him. I, without a doubt, accepted the job and will start on 3/18. So here’s the interesting part. I’m employee #2 in a 30 person team….that means I need to hire at 28 developers! It gets better. The project is super secret. I can’t tell you what the app is about until you come in for an interview and after you sign an NDA. That, honestly, is cool. I’ve never been able to say I worked on an app that I can’t tell anyone about. I’m sure Mary J. Foley will try to figure it out, but I don’t think she will :) You’ll find the job description below. Here’s how to apply: Apply on the official MS site here. I know the job description says SDE II and 2+ years of experience, but that is just the minimum for us to get the job posted on the careers site. It’s totally okay for you to have more experience and levels will be figured out after your interview and before we make you an offer. Send me a note with a link to your online resume (linkedin, stackoverflow, etc) here. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for submitting your resume. Good luck! Jon SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER No legacy code. Windows 8 app. We are entering into a new market for Microsoft. We are developing a key application combining features of Bing into a truly native experience for Windows. We are the User Centric Advertising team and we are going to push the limits of the social graph and machine learning to deliver a world class experience on Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and the Web. We just got the green light from the leadership team to move forward with the project and we now need to hire a team of engineers to go build it. We haven’t fleshed out all the details, but that is a good thing. You can come in and see the project blossom from the ground up and influence the direction of it. One thing we know for sure is that we have the drive and know the product and team are going to be amazing. We will be a tightknit team of engineers that put shipping the product above all other artificial boundaries. Our team members with more feature development background will do most of the feature code and our team members with more of an automation background will do most of the automation development…but you will work together to ship. Mutual ownership at its finest. Most of us on the team haven’t developed Windows 8 applications yet. It would be a plus to have Windows 8 development experience, but not required. We are a bunch of web developers that are experts in building applications using the latest and greatest technologies including MVC, jQuery and a slew of other technologies that other teams rarely get the opportunity to experiment with. You don’t need join a startup to have the startup vibe, come join us and get all the same benefits of a startup culture with the security of all that Microsoft has to offer. Required Experience: 2+ years relevant web development experience Fluent in multiple web technologies with hands on experience in many of these areas: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, jQuery, ASP.NET, WebApi, MVC, JSON, RSS/ATOM Must demonstrate strong skill in C#, VB, Java or C++ Understanding of Agile Methodology BS in Computer Science or related field or equivalent experiencePluses: Windows 8 Application Development A/B Testing Experience Experience building reliable, large-scale web sites or services Good understanding of web performance and scalability concerns FAQ: You have to relocate to Redmond. You have to have valid work status. US Citizen or H1B that you can transfer.

It’s been around since 2009, but no one has addressed the issue. Here’s the bug report on ASP.NET forums: http://forums.asp.net/t/1417973.aspx and here’s the bug report filed to Mozilla for the FF issue. Neither of them have a solution. I narrowed it down to these lines of code in WebResource.axd – the one with the Validator control JavaScript that starts with var Page_ValidationVer = “125”; if (m != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (m[2].length == 4 || val.dateorder == \"ymd\")) &#123; year = (m[5].length == 4) ? m[5] : GetFullYear(parseInt(m[6], 10)) The root of the problem is that the WebResource JavaScript isn’t checking if “m[2]” and “m[5]” are undefined before checking the “length” property. The obvious fix is to do just that, but it’s embedded in an automatically generated WebResource.axd file. You can’t edit it directly, but since Microsoft didn’t scope the JavaScript properly you can override that method if you insert a method with the same name at the bottom of the page. Here’s how I resolved it: 1. Create a new .js file called WebResourceOverrides.js 2. Copy the entire “ValidatorConvert” method from the WebResource.axd file to the file I created in Step 1. 3. Modify the method to check for undefined // added m[2] undefined check because it was failing in FF and Chromeif (m != null &amp;&amp; ( (typeof(m[2]) != 'undefined' &amp;&amp; m[2].length == 4) || val.dateorder == \"ymd\")) &#123;...// added m[5] undefined check because it was failing in FF and Chromeyear = (typeof m[5] != 'undefined' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; m[5].length == 4) ? m[5] : GetFullYear(parseInt(m[6], 10)) 4.

Just remove the “.txt” extension, copy to your site, add the reference to the bottom of your master page and you are good to go.

I was expecting at least 720p since it was advertised as HD, but the highest resolution available was 480p. Here’s the definition of HD video from Wikipedia: High-definition video is video of higher resolution than is standard. While there is no specific meaning for high-definition, generally any video image with more than 480 horizontal lines (North America) or 570 lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. 720 scan lines is generally the minimum even though many systems greatly exceed that. Here’s how it played out last night. I go to Amazon.com and find Argo but they only have it in SD for laptop. You can stream HD to Kindle Fire HD, Xbox 360, PS3, Roku, TiVO or other compatible devices, but I don’t have any of them. I go to YouTube.com and find Argo and they have (what I think is) the HD version for the same price as Amazon.com, $3.99. See the “HD” next to the price below? Wouldn’t you think that means 720p or better? I purchase it from YouTube.com and start to play it. I want to make sure I am getting at least 720p, so I click on settings and see this…480p being the highest resolution available. I was on WiFi at the time so I thought it might be due to my network connection speed – sometimes streaming services will do what is called “adaptive streaming”, which means it will adjust the resolution that is streamed based on the users internet connection. I plug my laptop into the wired network and check my network speed. I’m getting my usual 92mbps. Yes, you can hate me. So now I know it’s not a problem with my internet connection. I go back to the movie details page and see this: Ah ha! Under the movie title, it states the the movie is “Quality: 480 (DVD equivalent)”. So that is the max resolution I can get. I’m a little peeved, but I want to watch the movie and I figure I can deal with YouTube the next day to get my money back. 3/4/2013: I called YouTube this morning. They don’t have phone support, so I will send them the details through online support and see if I can get my money back or a credit. I’ll update this post once I hear back from them. 3/6/2013: I got an email from YouTube. They gave me a credit and are going to report the issue to the content team.

Like so many devs out there, I was recently faced with that exact question. It turns out that there are two options for doing so 1) Build HTML5 web apps and a bunch of shell apps, one for each of the platform or 2) build native apps for each of the platforms. Since I don’t have expertise in all of the platforms or the time and money to get ramped up on all of them, I decided to look into the first option. I was also fortunate enough to hear about a new cross-platform development framework that DevExpress was working on called DXTREME. DXTREME is designed to help you build apps for Android, Apple, and Windows 8 using technologies that web devs know inside and out like HTML, JavaScript, CSS and a XAML (for Win8 only). It includes a set of libraries, controls and other assets that abstract away the complexities of building applications for all of these different platforms. It integrates directly with Visual Studio and comes with a project template that you can use to build apps. It is built on two different stacks: HTML5 and XAML. The HTML5 stack is for building Android, Apple, and Windows 8 applications using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It allows you to create apps that share appearance and multi-touch functionality across platforms, but are also compatible with the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store and the Windows Store. The XAML stack is for building native Windows 8 applications for developers who are already familiar with WPF or Silverlight. I’m going to bring you through my experience of running through DXTREME to create a basic application. Hopefully it will give you an idea of what ramp up time would look like for someone who is using DXTREME for the first time. Starting a Multi-Channel Application Project For this first exercise I selected the Multi-channel Application template, which is what you'll want to use to create cross-platform mobile apps using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It turns out that you're basically building a single-page web application (SPA) using the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. The ViewModel uses Knockout, and the whole thing is tied together with Apache Cordova, which allows you to publish to the Apple App Store or Google Play. After selecting the Multi-channel application template, a solution is generated with 4 projects, one for Desktop, one for Mobile, one for Win8 and one Shared: [![clip_image001[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0014_thumb.png \"clip_image001[4]\") It compiles out of the box. ========== Build: 4 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== With the Desktop app selected I hit F5 to see what happens. It opened this sample app. Back in Visual Studio, I select the Mobile project and hit F5 to open it in the simulator. [ What’s in the Project? Let's get back into Visual Studio and dig around the projects a bit. In the Desktop project you see a project reference to the Shared project. No other DLLs are required. That is good. [![clip_image007[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0074_thumb.png \"clip_image007[4]\") I poke around and find a file called app.js in the root of the project. Cracking that open I find this code snippet, which uses the DXTREME framework to new up an HtmlApplication object. $(function() &#123; Application2.app = new DevExpress.framework.html.HtmlApplication(&#123; ns: Application2, viewPortNode: document.getElementById(\"viewPort\"), defaultLayout: Application2.config.defaultLayout, navigation: Application2.config.navigation &#125;); Application2.app.router.register(\":view/:id\", &#123; view: \"About\", id: undefined &#125;);&#125;); The other projects are more of the same. Common logic is shared between applications, but you can dig into the individual files to tweak or enhance platform or device-specific features. One cool thing I notice is that they implemented a custom editor for their views. It allows you to preview the views from within Visual Studio. That is nice. [![clip_image010[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0104_thumb.png \"clip_image010[4]\") Learning DXTREME from the Docs You can find the HTML docs here: [http://help.devexpress.com/HTML/#!Overview](http://help.devexpress.com/HTML/#!Overview) and the Windows 8 docs here: [http://help.devexpress.com/#XAML/CustomDocument12019](http://help.devexpress.com/#XAML/CustomDocument12019) The HTML5 docs look good. There is a simple walk-through that looks a lot like the knockout one and it does a decent job of explaining what goes into building a DXTREME app. [![clip_image012[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0124_thumb.jpg \"clip_image012[4]\")](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0124.jpg) DXTREME also includes several sample apps to get you started and provide examples of how the templates and DevExpress controls work together. Here's the app that launches when you launch DXTREME. It has pointers to demos and sample apps. [![clip_image014[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0144_thumb.jpg \"clip_image014[4]\")](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0144.jpg) Let's take a look at the CRM HTML JS app and see what it tells us about building a DXTREME app. The CRM app includes 5 projects [![clip_image015[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0154_thumb.png \"clip_image015[4]\") Everything looks self-explanatory. Most of this looks like the Multi-Channel project template, except this one doesn't have a Win8 project (there is a separate demo for that) and it includes a Service project. Let's dig into the solution. The ViewModels are in the Shared project. [![clip_image016[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0164_thumb.png \"clip_image016[4]\") And look like this...a basic Knockout ViewModel. [ShipperViewModel.js] (function() &#123; DXCRM.ShipperViewModel = function(data) &#123; this.ShipperID = ko.observable(); this.CompanyName = ko.observable(); this.Phone = ko.observable(); if(data) this.fromJS(data); &#125;;&#125;)(); And they are used in the application views: [![clip_image017[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0174_thumb.png \"clip_image017[4]\") Here's Shippers.js as an example. [Shippers.js] DXCRM.Shippers = function(params) &#123; return &#123; dataSource: new DevExpress.data.SimpleDataSource(&#123; store: DXCRM.db.Shippers, map: function(item) &#123; return new DXCRM.ShipperViewModel(item); &#125; &#125;)&#125;;&#125;; Those same ViewModels are being used in the WinJS project. That is great. I can see that there is code reuse going on between the HTML based projects. The demo applications are generated automatically via the DXTREME Project Wizard using the Microsoft NorthWind sample database. Obviously you can use your own data, but this is a nice way to get data into the application as you experiment. I then focused on the separate XAML solution for the Win8 app. It looks like a standard Win8 app that uses DXTREME controls. Deployment So now that you have the app developed you need to package it up and get it ready to ship to Microsoft, Apple and Google. So, let's say I built the CRM app and I want to deploy it. There are two solutions, one for Win8 and one for everything else. Let's try the deploying the latter. I go to the first project in the solution, the \"Desktop\" project. Right clicking on that gives me a \"Build Native Package\" option: [![clip_image018[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0184_thumb.png \"clip_image018[4]\") Which launches this dialog: [![clip_image020[4]](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0204_thumb.jpg \"clip_image020[4]\")](/images/blog/dxtreme_CE2A/clip_image0204.jpg) Like most .NET devs, let's say I've never shipped an Android or iOS application. I would have no idea what to do with this screen. I then wander over to the DXTREME help docs because I remember seeing something about deployment in that earlier. I find the \"Native Packages\" section here: [http://help.devexpress.com/HTML/#!Overview/Application/Native%20Packages](http://help.devexpress.com/HTML/#!Overview/Application/Native%20Packages) It turns out that I need to register for the Apple and Google developer programs and I can get my certificate files from them. DXTREME provides a link to the Apple and Google program and a link to XCA to generate the certificate. There's some platform-specific knowledge you're going to need before deploying on multiple platforms. Because Apple, Google and Microsoft have their own stores, registration requirements, certificates and so on, you'll have to spend some time learning about that. DXTREME simplifies much of the cross-platform coding experience, but there's not a one-click solution for deployment. Final Thoughts After spending a couple of hours with DXTREME it looks like a good step in the right direction towards cross-platform application development. It's great that I can utilize the technologies that I already know and having the DXTREME controls adaptively render based on platform is great. I spent a little time looking into what it would take to ramp up on iOS and Android development and as a .NET developer I would definitely rather take the time to ramp up on DXTREME. I look forward to digging into DXTREME a little more and to seeing where they go with it in future releases. Jon title: First look at the Intel IvyBridge Ultrabook tags: review visual studio categories: [Tech, Reviews] alias: 2012/09/intel-ivybridge-ultrabook-first-look.html date: 2012-09-27 20:32:00 Intel just sent me an IvyBridge Ultrabook to try out and review as a development machine. It’s not a final machine and won’t ever be sold by Intel. The main purpose of the machine is to show what can be built with Windows 8 and Intel components. To do so, it comes with sensors including: 5 point multi-touch screen accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope ambient light sensor GPS NFC I’m not sure how I’m going to integrate the usage of these sensors into web dev, but I can definitely see an opportunity with mobile apps. I have had a lot of opportunity to play with other Ultrabooks on the market, so I was surprised that it wasn’t as thin and light as the others. Yes, it is a pre-production machine that will never be on the market, but they haven’t quite hit the mark with size and portability yet. It shipped with a non-RTM version of Windows 8, so the first thing I did was install RTM on it. The OS installed quickly as did Office and Visual Studio. I was up and running with my normal tools in a couple of hours. I haven’t done any real dev on this machine, but from what I’ve seen so far, it is fast. Switching apps, moving around Windows, using Office and IE are all instantaneous. I’m very curious to see how this thing does with 5 instances of Visual Studio and Resharper. My gut is that 4GB of RAM isn’t going to scale since each instance of VS usually takes about 500MB in resting state. They are definitely going to need to ship these with more RAM if they are to be considered a true dev machine. I personally can’t use any laptop trackpad and keyboard for very long, but the trackpad and keyboard that ships with it is a little more difficult to use than other Ultrabooks I’ve used. I definitely need to figure out a way to set this up to work with my normal mouse and keyboard and multi-monitors. I’ll do more in-depth reviews in the weeks to follow. Jon Disclosure of Material Connection: Like I mentioned above, Intel sent me the Ultrabook and are letting me keep the device so I can continue to give them feedback on it as a dev machine.

There’s no way I’m going to pay for additional account so we can both listen at the same time. I recommend that Spotify change to IP based restrictions to allow people to authorize multiple devices for their account. The way around this limitation is download all the tracks you think you’ll listen to ahead of time and put one of the devices in Offline Mode. 1.

Being frugal doesn’t mean you are cheap. I means you are wise in how you spend your money. I will pay a lot of money for something if I think it is worth it. I usually wouldn’t ever consider paying $329 for a blender, but one of my friends convinced me that the Blendtec was worth it. I figured that since it use it every morning it might be something to invest in. I picked one up from Costco for $329 the other day. I was really impressed by how you just have to press one button once to chop a full stack of fruits and vegetables, but I wasn’t blown away by the results. Yes, it made a very smooth smoothie, but was it $300 better? This morning I decided to do a side-by-side comparison, using the exact same ingredients, to see which one I liked better and if I should keep the Blendtec or not. You can skip to the “BLEND &amp; POUR” section below to see the video of them both in action. THE BLENDERS OSTER 16 SPEED BLENDER BLENDTEC WILDSIDE HP3A BLEDNER [![P-156](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-156_thumb.jpg \"P-156\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-156.jpg) [![P-154](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-154_thumb.jpg \"P-154\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-154.jpg) THE INGREDIENTS Water, Frozen Blackberries, Apple, Orange, Banana, Celery, Spinach, Tomato, Kale &amp; Pure Protein Whey THE BLENDERS WITH THE INGREDIENTS [![P-178](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-178_thumb.jpg \"P-178\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-178.jpg) [![P-180](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-180_thumb.jpg \"P-180\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-180.jpg) THE BLEND &amp; POUR I created this video so you can get an idea for what the blend experience looks like side-by-side. THE RESULTS Consistency OSTER 16 SPEED BLENDER BLENDTEC WILDSIDE HP3A BLEDNER [![P-196-2](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-196-2_thumb.jpg \"P-196-2\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-196-2.jpg) [![P-198-2](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-198-2_thumb.jpg \"P-198-2\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-198-2.jpg) OSTER AFTER ANOTHER MINUTE OF BLENDING [![P-200-2](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-200-2_thumb.jpg \"P-200-2\")](/images/blog/blendtec-wildside-vs_F4E9/P-200-2.jpg) As you can see from the images and video above the Blendtec definitely makes a smoother smoothie, while the Oster is grainy. Letting the Oster run for another minute gets you closer to the Blendtec, but it’s still not as smooth. I did a blindfold taste test with myself and my wife. We could tell the difference and liked the Blendtec better, but both determined that it’s not $300 better. The Blendtec smoothie didn’t have many traces of blackberry seeds and was smoother. As you can see in the video the Oster takes a little babysitting when you first get started and sometimes it gets jammed. The Blendtec is awesome in that regard. Just load it up, hit one button and it takes care of it. It basically does the same thing you have to do manually with the Oster. You start slow with the ice crusher mode and then speed it up for the finish. PROS &amp; CONS OSTER BLENDTEC PROS Cheap ($40) Very smooth consistency Doesn’t need to be babysat. Hit one button and it takes care of the rest. Very little trace of blackberry seeds CONS Thicker consistency Needs babysitting Gets jammed sometimes Has all of the blackberry seeds Expensive ($329 – Costco, $455 – Amazon) It’s hard to describe the difference with words, but the bottom line is that if a little rougher consistency and a little extra time it takes bothers you and it is worth $300 to get rid of that then go with the Blendtec. If not, then stick with your old Blender. I ultimately decided that it wasn’t worth the extra $300 and returned the Blendtec to Costco. Hope this helps you determine which blender is a better fit for your patience and budget. **UPDATE: 3/9/2013 – **I ended up going back to Costco and bought the Blendtec again. This makes for a great story, but for 1 week after I brought it back I was making smoothies with my Oster…all the while thinking about how much time I could be saving if I had the Blendtec. For that 1 week I was very cognizant of how much time I spent cutting everything up, babysitting it and cleaning it….maybe 10 minutes per day more than the Blendtec. If you make smoothies almost every day like I do then that adds up quick. I think I’m over the sticker shock now because I haven’t had any more thoughts of bringing it back. $300 is a lot, but I now think it is worth it.

I use it watch TV shows like White Collar and Lie to Me and my kid watches Thomas &amp; Friends, Curious George, Go Diego Go, etc. I don’t usually watch movies on Netflix, because I have seen all the movies I want to see in the Netflix catalog and it takes me more time to find a movie I want to watch then actually watching movies. I use the Redbox kiosks at least 2 times a month. I’m so “frugal” that I usually only rent from them when they send me the free promo codes via SMS and I always return them on time. So, take this review from that perspective: TV shows, Kid shows and an occasional Redbox kiosk user. The bottom line is that I won’t be switching to Redbox Instant any time soon. They don’t have TV shows, they don’t have Thomas &amp; Friends and their movie catalog is even worse than Netflix. Redbox Instant has some great features that Netflix doesn’t have, which I get into below, but they aren’t enough for me to make a move.

I’m hoping that you are reading this now because you want to implement a email notifications and want to know what the unwritten rules are for allowing people to unsubscribe from them. Don’t take it personal when someone wants to unsubscribe from your email notifications. Make it easy and they will probably sign back up in the future. Make it difficult and they will remember that and never sign up for your notifications again. Some sites like LinkedIn and Facebook allow you to granularly configure email notification preferences. This post isn’t necessarily targeting those complex email notification systems, but the basic rules apply. Keep your users happy by making it very easy to stop getting email from you. Oh btw, it’s also the law. You can read more about it on the Bureau of Consumer Protection website’s CAN-SPAM Act: A Compliance Guide for Business page. On Your Website Allow users to opt-in or opt-out of email notifications when they are creating their account. Include a “Notifications” section under your “Profile” section that allows users to unsubscribe from individual topics or unsubscribe from all email notifications. Include an “Unsubscribe” page that you link to from your email notifications. This page will serve two purposes: In Your Email Notifications Include a link with the word “Unsubscribe” in it. That link will open the page on your site I mentioned above and will immediately unsubscribe the user from email notifications without asking them any more questions. Do not require user to login to unsubscribe. It’s often a pain to sign into sites on mobile device and sometimes the user will forget their credentials. Include some token in your unsubscribe mail that maps to the user. It’s difficult to hack that and even if someone did, it’s only email notifications and shouldn’t allow the user to perform any other action. Immediately unsubscribe the user from the email notification. Don’t tell the user that they will keep getting emails for weeks or months while the request is processed. There’s no good reason to do that. Just have a bit in your database that gets unflipped when they unsubscribe. If that bit is unflipped then don’t send notifications.* Allow users to unsubscribe without telling you why they are unsubscribing. It’s fine if you want to ask the user why they are leaving, but don’t require them to fill out a form before unsubscribing. Make it easy. * **Allow users to unsubscribe by replying to the email. **Unsubscribe users if they respond the word “unsubscribe” in the subject or in the body of my response. Do not send an unsubscribe confirmation email to the users. The users are trying to reduce the amount of mail from you. Don’t send yet another another email telling them they won’t be getting any emails from you. * Don’t require users to “download pictures” of the email to unsubscribe. As mentioned above the unsubscribe links should be text not an image.

You can read about my initial thoughts in my “First Look at the Intel IvyBridge Ultrabook” and my thoughts after a using it for a couple of weeks in my “A deeper look at the Intel IvyBridge Ultrabook” post. I have been using it off and on since then, so I thought I’d share a couple more comments and let you decide if you should buy an Ultrabook as a dev machine. The biggest advantages to using this Ultrabook has been its portability, battery life and touch screen. Ultrabooks are so much lighter and smaller than typical laptops that it makes it easy to throw in your bag or carry around the office. With my current laptop setup I have to bring my laptop and a massive power adapter (total about 7 lbs) whenever I leave my desk. The Ultrabook is so light that I don’t even realize it is in my bag and the extended battery life means I don’t have to carry my power adapter everywhere I go. I mainly used the Ultrabook when on the road and I could go days without charging it. I never measured it the exact length, but it is definitely a lot longer than a typical laptop. As for the touch screen, this is where the machine shines. I find myself now trying to touch and swipe any laptop screen because I’m so used to it with the Ultrabook. Every machine I purchase from now on will have a touch screen. Like I mentioned in my second review, the biggest drawback to this prototype is the lack of docking station support. And that is honestly why I didn’t use the machine as much as I would have liked to. If it would have had docking station support I would have taken it with me to the office more. Because it doesn’t have a docking station I would have to take both my Lenovo W510 and the Ultrabook with me. Yes, it is light, but I couldn’t justify carrying two of everything back and forth. The answer to the question “Does an Ultrabook Make a Good Dev Machine?” is yes, it does…but make sure you get one with docking station support. Otherwise you will be manually connecting and reconnecting all your monitors and devices everything you move locations. No big deal if you work from one location all the time, but I assume most of us go from home to the office and need very fast dock and undock capabilities. Jon title: First look at the Intel IvyBridge Ultrabook tags: review visual studio categories: [Tech, Reviews] alias: 2012/09/intel-ivybridge-ultrabook-first-look.html date: 2012-09-27 20:32:00 Intel just sent me an IvyBridge Ultrabook to try out and review as a development machine. It’s not a final machine and won’t ever be sold by Intel. The main purpose of the machine is to show what can be built with Windows 8 and Intel components. To do so, it comes with sensors including: 5 point multi-touch screen accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope ambient light sensor GPS NFC I’m not sure how I’m going to integrate the usage of these sensors into web dev, but I can definitely see an opportunity with mobile apps. I have had a lot of opportunity to play with other Ultrabooks on the market, so I was surprised that it wasn’t as thin and light as the others. Yes, it is a pre-production machine that will never be on the market, but they haven’t quite hit the mark with size and portability yet. It shipped with a non-RTM version of Windows 8, so the first thing I did was install RTM on it. The OS installed quickly as did Office and Visual Studio. I was up and running with my normal tools in a couple of hours. I haven’t done any real dev on this machine, but from what I’ve seen so far, it is fast. Switching apps, moving around Windows, using Office and IE are all instantaneous. I’m very curious to see how this thing does with 5 instances of Visual Studio and Resharper. My gut is that 4GB of RAM isn’t going to scale since each instance of VS usually takes about 500MB in resting state. They are definitely going to need to ship these with more RAM if they are to be considered a true dev machine. I personally can’t use any laptop trackpad and keyboard for very long, but the trackpad and keyboard that ships with it is a little more difficult to use than other Ultrabooks I’ve used. I definitely need to figure out a way to set this up to work with my normal mouse and keyboard and multi-monitors. I’ll do more in-depth reviews in the weeks to follow. Jon Disclosure of Material Connection: Like I mentioned above, Intel sent me the Ultrabook and are letting me keep the device so I can continue to give them feedback on it as a dev machine.

Connecting and disconnecting Bluetooth devices to one machine is easy, just turn it on and off. The trouble comes when you need to connect and disconnect from multiple devices – Windows depends on third party drivers to help and the result is a non-intuitive experience. As I mentioned in my “How to Quickly Connect a Bluetooth Device to a Windows 7 Machine” post, it wasn’t simple to figure out how to do that in Windows 7 and it’s even harder in Windows 8. The Windows 8 Devices App only allows you to Add and Remove the device. It would be great if I could just double click on a device that is already paired to reestablish the connection, but that isn’t supported for now. I am discussing the issue with the Bluetooth team and they are working on getting this into their backlog. The short answer to this post is that there isn’t a way to quickly connect a Bluetooth device in Windows 8. But I will show you the only two options I discovered. If you haven’t done so already then you should find out who manufacture’s your Bluetooth stack and get their Windows 8 drivers. My PC uses the Broadcom Bluetooth stack (Download) so your experience will be different if you have a different stack, but it should pretty similar. Option 1 – Control Panel &amp; the Bluetooth Driver This is the option that I prefer. It still isn’t very fast, but it is faster than Option 2 because it doesn’t require you to add and remove the device every time you want to connect it. There is a little bit of initial setup, but it is worth it over time. Connect Your Device 1. Follow the “How to Connect the Device to Your Computer” section under Option 2 below to establish your initial connection. Setup the Taskbar Icon This will allow you to quickly launch into “Devices and Printers” on your computer. 1. Create a Shortcut to “Devices and Printers” by following the steps on this page: How to Create a “Devices and Printers” Shortcut in Windows 7 2. Drag that Shortcut into your Taskbar How to Reconnect Your Device 1. Put the Bluetooth device in pairing mode. Read the documentation for the device to find out How to do this. For the RF-MAB2, you just need to hold down the button that has the icon of an old school phone for about 6 seconds. 2. Click on the icon in your taskbar that you created above. That will launch Devices and Printers. 2. Right click on your device and click Control. 3. Click Connect There will be a series of beeps and then your device will be connected Option 2 – Windows 8 Devices App With this approach you need to manually remove and then re-add the device every time you want to connect it. How to Connect the Device to Your Computer 1. Put the Bluetooth device in pairing mode. Read the documentation for the device to find out how to do this. For the RF-MAB2, you just need to hold down the button that has the icon of an old school phone for about 6 seconds. 2. Launch the Windows 8 Devices App. You can get there by double clicking the Bluetooth icon in your system tray or by hitting Windows key and then typing in “devices” and click on Settings then click on Devices. 3. Click “Add a device” and your device will be added. How to Reconnect the Device to Your Computer This is where Windows 8 is lacking. It would be great if I could just load up the Devices App and double click on my device to reconnect it, but double click doesn’t do anything.

I take backups seriously because many years of hard work would be gone if something happened to that data. I’m sure you are in the same boat. Get a backup strategy now before you regret it. Backup Strategy Goals Make sure I don’t permanently lose my hard work. Be able to easily recover from a temporary loss of work. Backup Strategy Components Laptop’s Local Hard drive 2 External USB Drives connected to my docking station (Drive letters: L and M) Cloud File Locations I source documents (code, word, visio, etc) on my laptop’s local hard drive, because I always need those docs. I source media (music, photos, videos) on an external drive (L) that is connected to my docking station at home. I don’t have those files on my laptop’s local hard drive, because do most of my creative media work at home and I don’t usually need them during the day. The Strategy I use Windows 8 File History to backup my laptop’s local hard drive to my first external hard drive (L). I import my media files from SD cards directly to my first external hard drive (L). I use CrashPlan to backup my media and my Windows 8 File History log to both the cloud and my second external drive. Setup **1. Setup Windows 8 File History to sync from laptop to external drive ** Windows 8 File History backs up your “Windows Library” folders. To find your library folder just open Windows Explorer and find “Libraries” &gt; If you want Windows 8 File History to back up something you need to add it to a Library. You can do that by right clicking on it and selecting “Include in library”, then select the library you want to include it in or create a new one. 2. Setup CrashPlan to sync to an external drive (M) 3. Setup CrashPlan to sync to the cloud My Local Drives and Folders C is my laptop’s local hard drive. It just contains “_docs” which has the docs I need for work (code, word, visio, etc) **L **is my first external hard drive. It contains “_media” which is where I source media files from SD cards and it has FileHistory, which is where Windows 8 File History creates it’s log. **M **is my second external hard drive. It contains the CrashPlan encrypted versions of my L drive. You will also notice that under /Libraries/Documents/ I have included the “_docs” folder from my C drive. Including that folder in a Library allows it to be picked up by Windows 8 File History. Precautions Make sure you get the CrashPlan email notifications. They will tell you when you haven’t backed up in a while and will tell you when you aren’t 100% backed up. File Recovery If my laptop’s local hard drive crashes, I can recover the files from my first external drive (L). If my first external drive (L) crashes, I can recover the files from CrashPlan. If CrashPlan is down, I can recover the files from my second external drive (M). If my house burns down, I can recover the files from CrashPlan. Wrap up I lot of people have more sophisticated backup strategies than I do. Like an offsite physical backup where they swap drives every time they visit that location. But that is over kill for me. The only time I would need that is if CrashPlan was down and both of my hard drives crashed or my house burned down at the same time CrashPlan was down. Possible, but not something I’m worried about. Hope this helps you develop your own backup strategy and saves you from losing your work. Hanselman is also passionate about backups.

Starbucks, Tully's, Seattle's Best or Café Ladro?","slug":"best-priced-latte","date":"2012-11-09T05:37:00.000Z","updated":"2016-12-29T03:37:00.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/11/best-priced-latte/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2012/11/best-priced-latte/","excerpt":"","text":"I drink a lot of coffee. I’ll grab a latte every once and a while and don’t have loyalty to any particular company. I like most coffee brands and could easy grab a Costco latte and be content. This post isn’t about coffee flavor. It’s about getting the most caffeine for the least amount of money and where to find the best deal for your favorite size. Skip down to the “OVERALL OBSERVATIONS” section at the end if you just want the wrap up info. I was recently wondering…which coffee company out there has the best price to espresso ratio? So, on my way to work the other day I called a bunch of coffee shops to get some price and shot count per size. I compared Starbucks, Tully’s, Seattle’s Best and Café Ladro. I chose those companies because they are close to my office. They were all very cool about giving me the info, so I thought I’d share. No ulterior motive here, just sharing my research and thoughts. For each company, I called two different stores so I could verify the prices were correct. The prices do not include tax. I called locations in the Seattle, WA area. Taste is a big factor when it comes to selecting your coffee. To remove subjectivity from this post, I don’t talk about my taste preference, just the numbers. Taste is subjective, numbers aren’t. As a side note, Seattle’s Best and Café Ladro use whole milk by default. Everyone else uses 2%. So if you were wondering why Seattle’s Best and Café Ladro are so thick and frothy, that is why. I compare them in two ways. The first is how they compare by default. That’s is what you would get if you were to go into all of these coffee shops and ask for a normal latte. The second is how they compare when they all use the same espresso to milk ratio. Café Ladro puts more shots in the smaller sizes than the others, so I wanted to see how a 2 shot Tall latte from Starbucks compares to a 2 shot Tall latte from Café Ladro. If you want the absolute best deal then get a Costco latte. $1 for 12oz. Maybe not the greatest tasting, but it’s a great deal. I excluded them from the data below because they are an anomaly. THE DATA Green = Least Expensive, Red = Most Expensive DEFAULT COMPARISON OBSERVATIONS Observations in this list are for the \"DEFAULT\" data above. The numbers to the left of the \"Extra Shot Price\" column. That's what you would get if you were to go into all of these coffee shops and ask for a normal latte. Café Ladro is always the most expensive overall price, but their Short and Tall sizes have 2 shots whereas everyone else only has one shot, so their “price/shot” is the lowest in those sizes. Café Ladro has the best price per shot in Short and Tall. Seattle’s Best has the best price per shot in Grande and Venti. A Tall at Seattle’s Best is the same price as Starbucks Small. That’s 4oz of milk for free if you go with Seattle’s Best. All companies put 2 shots of espresso in Grande. So, if you order a Grande you will get the same espresso/milk ratio from all. Seattle’s Best is always the least expensive, except the Short size, which is Starbucks. That is because Seattle’s Best doesn’t make a Short latte. The strongest espresso to milk ratio is Café Ladro’s Short latte. The only reason you’d ever want to get a Short latte is if you like the “.33” espresso/milk taste from Café Latte. At Starbucks it is only 10 cents more for a Tall and 30 cents more for a Tall at the others. You get 4 more ounces of milk for pennies by going with a Tall. The least expensive price / shot is Seattle’s Best Venti latte. It’s 3 shots for $3.40 or $1.13 a shot. MATCH COMPARISON OBSERVATIONS Observations in this list are for the “MATCH” data above. The numbers to the right of the “Extra Shot Price” column. That’s what you would get if you were to add shots to each size to match the espresso/milk ratio to the highest in the list. The most obvious observation is that when all things are equal Seattle’s Best is the least expensive in Tall, Grande and Venti sizes. For the Short size, Café Ladro is the least expensive. They were the most expensive in the DEFAULT comparison, but when all things are equal they are least expensive. Tully’s has the most expensive double Tall latte at $3.50. Starbucks has the most expensive Venti latte at $4.50 total or $1.50 per shot. OVERALL OBSERVATIONS If you want a Short and only one shot then go to Starbucks. If you want 2 shots then go to Café Ladro. If you want a Tall, either one or two shots, then go to Seattle’s Best. It’s $2.55 for one shot and $3.20 for two. If you want a Grande then go to Seattle’s Best for $3.10 or Starbucks for $3.35. If you want a Venti then go to Seattle’s Best. It’s 3 shots for $3.40, which is 55 cents less expensive than Tully’s, the next least expensive Venti in the list. If you go to Starbucks you can save 5 cents if you order a Grande instead of a 2 shot Tall, but the espresso milk ratio will be different. 5 cents isn’t a big deal, so try them both and see which one you prefer. Since you are getting the same amount of espresso with either of them it will come down to taste. It doesn’t look like a Short latte is a wise decision, unless you like that espresso to milk ratio. You can get a Tall for 10 cents more at Starbucks. A “Double Tall” latte doesn’t make much sense either. You can get a Grande (which already comes with 2 shots) for the same or less money. But if you prefer the espresso/milk ratio of a “Double Tall” then go for it. Just know you can get 4oz of milk for free you go with Grande. The Starbucks Venti latte doesn’t ever look like a good option. It only has 2 shots by default and the price jumps to $4.50 if you add a shot. That’s even more expensive than Café Ladro. If you like the intensity of Café Ladro then you’ll need to order 2 shot Short or Tall or a 3 shot Venti from the other places. The most expensive shot of coffee you can buy is from Tully’s. Their 1 shot Tall latte is $2.90 The least expensive shot of coffee you can buy is from Seattle’s Best. Their 3 shot Venti latte comes out to $1.13 per shot. I hope this helps any one else out there with the same kind of questions that I had.

is the second post in a two part series on integrating SMS functionality into an application. In the first post, “A high-level look into Clickatell’s new SMS Small Business API”, I focused on the analysis I did into Clickatell’s Small Business API. This post focuses on the options available and technical details for integrating the API into your application. There are many options available for integrating Clickatell’s Small Business API into your application and Clickatell’s APIs &amp; Scripts page has all the info you need to get started. All of the specifications for all the protocols are available on their “Developer’s Central” page. The protocols available are: HTTP/S, XML, SOAP and COM object. There are other protocols listed on that page, like FTP and SMTP, but they don’t apply to the Small Business API. They have sample scripts available for PhP, VBScript, C#, VB.NET, Cold Fusion and Oracle and there are third party libraries available for Java, Perl, Ruby and Applescript. WHAT PROTOCOLS ARE AVAILABLE? HTTP: The HTTP option is pretty straightforward. Just pass your api_id, user, password, to and text to the /http/sendmsg endpoint and it will return a status and guid for the message. http://api.clickatell.com/http/sendmsg?api_id=xxxx&amp;amp;user=xxxx&amp;amp;password=xxxx&amp;amp;to=xxxx&amp;amp;text=xxxx XML: This is very similar to the HTTP endpoint, but instead of passing the data as individual querystring parameters you pass one “data” parameter with xml. The only reason I’d want to use XML instead of HTTP is if I have some client serialization code that already spits out XML. Otherwise, HTTP is more intuitive and requires less bandwidth. http://api.clickatell.com/xml/xml?data=&lt;clickAPI&gt;&lt;sendMsg&gt;&lt;api_id&gt;1&lt;/api_id&gt;&lt;user&gt;demo&lt;/user&gt;&lt;password&gt;demo&lt;/password&gt;&lt;to&gt;448311234567&lt;/to&gt;&lt;text&gt;Meet me outside&lt;/text&gt;&lt;from&gt;me&lt;/from&gt;&lt;/sendMsg&gt;&lt;/clickAPI&gt; SOAP: It looks complex, but this message is dynamically generated from the WSDL proxy. &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?&gt; &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:SOAP-ENC=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xmlns:tns=\"soap.clickatell.com\"&gt; &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;&lt;tns:sendmsg xmlns:tns=\"soap.clickatell.com\"&gt; &lt;session_id xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;api_id xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"&gt;1234&lt;/api_id&gt; &lt;user xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;demo&lt;/user&gt; &lt;password xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;demo&lt;/password&gt;&lt;to xsi:type=\"SOAP-ENC:Array\" SOAP-ENC:arrayType=\"xsd:string[2]\"&gt; &lt;item xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;2799912345&lt;/item&gt; &lt;item xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;27999123134&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/to&gt;&lt;from xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;me&lt;/from&gt; &lt;text xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;Initial test message&lt;/text&gt; &lt;concat xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;deliv_ack xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;callback xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;deliv_time xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;max_credits xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:float\"/&gt; &lt;req_feat xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;queue xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;escalate xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;mo xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;cliMsgId xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;unicode xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;msg_type xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;udh xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;data xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;validity xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;/tns:sendmsg&gt;&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt; &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt; COM: The COM option will be a good one to choose if you have legacy software that runs in a COM world. You could obviously get it to work with modern technologies, but you still have DLL HELL to consider. You have to register the DLL, create an INTEROP and go from there. I haven’t looked at COM in so long, but I still have nightmares about it. oSMS.SendSimpleSMS API_ID, \"username\", \"password\", \"278…\", \"My first SMS\" WHICH PROTOCOL SHOULD I CHOOSE? If you are using Java, Perl, Ruby or Applescript then the clear winner is to use one of the 3rd party libraries that you can find on the Scripts page. Nothing for .NET. Yes, they do have examples on how one would call their API using C#, but that is just code to issue a WebRequest. My recommendation for Clickatell is to create a .NET library and get it up on NuGet. So, as it stands right now, if you are using .NET then you are left with these options: HTTP or XML Write your own .NET 3rd Party Library COM SOAP HTTP or XML If you use HTTP or XML then you have to write your own code to process the response. Yes, Clickatell did a nice job telling you what all the responses would be in their HTTP and XML documentation, but you are probably like me and don’t have the time to write the code to process all the responses. Here’s what a typical response looks like: If you just need a very simple “fire and forget” SMS notification implementation and don’t care if it fails or succeeds then this is the best way to go. This is also a great option if you want to create an SMS from script. My recommendation for Clickatell on this one is to at least return the response as JSON so they are easily consumable from script. WRITE YOUR OWN .NET 3RD PARTY LIBRARY Just like the HTTP or XML option you are left to write a ton of code to wrap one of the protocols. This would be a big undertaking…more than I would expect any of my readers to implement. If you do decide to go this route, then start copying from the Java 3rd party library. COM Like most of you out there I got bit by COM in the late 90s so I try to avoid it like the plague. But, if that is your preference then go for it. Just be warned that you’ll need to be concerned with DLL registration and trust levels. The DLL might require full trust, something that isn’t supported in most shared hosting environments. They provide an MSI that installs the DLLs for you, but again installing an MSI in a shared hosting environment probably isn’t supported. SOAP It’s heavy, big and complex, but given all the other options currently available I think SOAP is probably the best option for .NET developers, because… 1. You can create a proxy that behaves like your own 3rd party library 2. You don’t have to write an HTTP endpoint wrapper WebRequest code 3. You don’t have to deal with COM and DLL hell. You still have to process all the response codes, but you’ll have to do that with any of the options. How to USE THE SOAP ENDPOINT IN A .NET APPLICATION 1. Open your app and add a service reference 2. Enter the Clickatell SOAP URL http://api.clickatell.com/soap/webservice.php?WSDL 3. Click “Go”. Enter a Namespace and click OK. That will generate your C# proxy and give you a class called PushServerWSPortTypeClient. You’ll use this class for all your SMS needs. 4. Add a using statement: (This will be different for your app) using ClickatellSample.Console.ClickatellProxy; 5. Instaniate a new PushServerWSPortTypeClient class: var client = new PushServerWSPortTypeClient(); 6. Call the auth method to get a session Id; var authResponse = client.auth([app_id], \"[username]\", \"[password]\"); if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(authResponse)&amp;&amp; authResponse.StartsWith(\"OK\"))&#123;//authResponse = \"OK: [sessionId]\"//authResponse is prefixed with an OK status code and then the sessionId so you need to parse it outvar colonIndex = authResponse.IndexOf(\":\", StringComparison.Ordinal);if (colonIndex != -1)&#123;var sessionId = authResponse.Substring(colonIndex + 2); // Add two to trim the colon and the space after it \": \" 7. Call the sendmsg method to send the SMS. var responses = client.sendmsg( sessionId, [app_id],\"[username]\",\"[password]\", new string[] &#123; \"[to]\" &#125;,\"[from]\",\"Test SMS\",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,string.Empty,0,string.Empty,string.Empty,string.Empty,0);foreach (var response in responses)&#123;//response = \"ID: [unique id of sms]\"System.Console.WriteLine(response);&#125; Here’s the complete code sample: var client = new PushServerWSPortTypeClient(); var authResponse = client.auth(123456, \"[username]\", \"[password]);if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(authResponse) &amp;&amp; authResponse.StartsWith(\"OK\"))&#123;//authResponse = \"OK: [sessionId]\" //authResponse is prefixed with an OK status code and then the sessionId so you need to parse it out var colonIndex = authResponse.IndexOf(\":\", StringComparison.Ordinal); if (colonIndex != -1) &#123; var sessionId = authResponse.Substring(colonIndex + 2); // Add two to trim the colon and the space after it \": \" System.Console.WriteLine(sessionId); var responses = client.sendmsg( sessionId, 123456, \"[username]\", \"[password]\", new string[] &#123; \"[to]\" &#125;,\"[from]\",\"Test SMS\", 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,string.Empty,0,string.Empty,string.Empty,string.Empty,0); foreach (var response in responses) &#123; //response = \"ID: [unique id of sms]\" System.Console.WriteLine(response); &#125; &#125; &#125; FINAL THOUGHTS Clickatell’s Small Business API is great if you want to integrate simple SMS functionality into your application. A simple HTTP request is all you need to send an SMS. They are behind the times when it comes to integrating SMS into a .NET application, but you can get HTTP/XML to work with WebRequest or you can create proxies to the COM or SOAP endpoints. I found out through using the endpoints that all of them require you to parse the response, i.e. “OK: [sessionId]”. This is obviously the result of the service being around for a very long time because modern day HTTP endpoints would return a JSON response that looks something like this “{status:‘ok’, sessionId:’[sessionId]}” and the SOAP endpoint would return a strongly typed object. This leaves a lot of work for developers because we have to account for every possible response and parse it appropriately. I was hoping the SOAP endpoint would deal with that for me, but it doesn’t. Here’s what I recommend they do to make their service more appealing to .NET developers. Create a .NET libraryPut that library up on NuGet so it is easy to install and updateParse all the response messages into strongly typed objects and enums.Simplify the API. As you can see in my sample above the “sendmsg” method takes 22 parameters, all but 3 are optional. I hope this SMS series gave you the information you need to get started with integrating SMS into your application and saved you some time. Jon title: First look at the Intel IvyBridge Ultrabook tags: review visual studio categories: [Tech, Reviews] alias: 2012/09/intel-ivybridge-ultrabook-first-look.html date: 2012-09-27 20:32:00 Intel just sent me an IvyBridge Ultrabook to try out and review as a development machine. It’s not a final machine and won’t ever be sold by Intel. The main purpose of the machine is to show what can be built with Windows 8 and Intel components. To do so, it comes with sensors including: 5 point multi-touch screen accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope ambient light sensor GPS NFC I’m not sure how I’m going to integrate the usage of these sensors into web dev, but I can definitely see an opportunity with mobile apps. I have had a lot of opportunity to play with other Ultrabooks on the market, so I was surprised that it wasn’t as thin and light as the others. Yes, it is a pre-production machine that will never be on the market, but they haven’t quite hit the mark with size and portability yet. It shipped with a non-RTM version of Windows 8, so the first thing I did was install RTM on it. The OS installed quickly as did Office and Visual Studio. I was up and running with my normal tools in a couple of hours. I haven’t done any real dev on this machine, but from what I’ve seen so far, it is fast. Switching apps, moving around Windows, using Office and IE are all instantaneous. I’m very curious to see how this thing does with 5 instances of Visual Studio and Resharper. My gut is that 4GB of RAM isn’t going to scale since each instance of VS usually takes about 500MB in resting state. They are definitely going to need to ship these with more RAM if they are to be considered a true dev machine. I personally can’t use any laptop trackpad and keyboard for very long, but the trackpad and keyboard that ships with it is a little more difficult to use than other Ultrabooks I’ve used. I definitely need to figure out a way to set this up to work with my normal mouse and keyboard and multi-monitors. I’ll do more in-depth reviews in the weeks to follow. Jon Disclosure of Material Connection: Like I mentioned above, Intel sent me the Ultrabook and are letting me keep the device so I can continue to give them feedback on it as a dev machine.

In this post, I focus on the analysis I did into Clickatell’s Small Business API. My second post in this series, “How to integrate Clickatell’s SMS Small Business API into a .NET application”, focuses on the options available and technical details for integrating the API into your application. Clickatell is a worldwide mobile messaging company that just released a Small Business API, which allows you to integrate SMS functionality into your small business applications. Their target audience is small businesses that want to integrate SMS into their business model. For example, appointment reminders or delivery notifications are perfect scenarios for this API. It is not intended for multi-national business that need to send thousands of messages in bulk. You’ll want to look into the other messaging capabilities that Clickatell provides if you need to support over 10k messages a month. My dentist sends me appointment reminders and the Small Business API would be a perfect solution for them to implement for that. Clickatell asked me to try it out and give them feedback so they can continue to improve the product. API RESEARCH Before I sat down to look at the API I came up with the following list of questions I would ask of any SMS API provider. Reliability – Do they guarantee message delivery? Can I get notified when messages are successfully sent? Usability – Can I quickly get what I need from the API? Is it easy to use? Networks and Countries – Do they support the mobile networks that the majority of my customers are on? Only US or entire world? Performance – What is the typical response time of the endpoint? Platform Support – Do they support .NET and JavaScript calls? Technical Support – What is response time for technical support inquires? Is there a phone number to call if needed? Availability – How many nines? Do they have downtime notifications? Pricing – How much does it cost per message? Rate Limiting – How much do they throttle messages? Media– Does it support MMS? RELIABILITY Do they guarantee message delivery? Can I get notified when messages are successfully sent? I found out through my research into SMS that ALL messaging providers cannot guarantee delivery, but they do provide interim and “last know” status for each message. Keep this in mind when you are developing your SMS solution. You’ll want to make sure that you track message status so you can resubmit on failures. You get the callback functionality by setting up a page that processes the callbacks and then you configure that page in your Clickatell account settings page. USABILITY Can I quickly get what I need from the API? Is it easy to use? Based on a cursory glance of their APIs &amp; Scripts it looks fairly straightforward to use. You can see more details in my second post: &quot;How to integrate Clickatell’s SMS Small Business API into a .NET application&quot; Here are some examples of what the endpoints look like to give you an idea of their usage: HTTP: http://api.clickatell.com/http/sendmsg?api_id=xxxx&amp;amp;user=xxxx&amp;amp;password=xxxx&amp;amp;to=xxxx&amp;amp;text=xxxx XML: http://api.clickatell.com/xml/xml?data=&lt;clickAPI&gt;&lt;sendMsg&gt;&lt;api_id&gt;1&lt;/api_id&gt;&lt;user&gt;demo&lt;/user&gt;&lt;password&gt;demo&lt;/password&gt;&lt;to&gt;448311234567&lt;/to&gt;&lt;text&gt;Meet me outside&lt;/text&gt;&lt;from&gt;me&lt;/from&gt;&lt;/sendMsg&gt;&lt;/clickAPI&gt; SOAP: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?&gt; &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:SOAP-ENC=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xmlns:tns=\"soap.clickatell.com\"&gt; &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;&lt;tns:sendmsg xmlns:tns=\"soap.clickatell.com\"&gt; &lt;session_id xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;api_id xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"&gt;1234&lt;/api_id&gt; &lt;user xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;demo&lt;/user&gt; &lt;password xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;demo&lt;/password&gt;&lt;to xsi:type=\"SOAP-ENC:Array\" SOAP-ENC:arrayType=\"xsd:string[2]\"&gt; &lt;item xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;2799912345&lt;/item&gt; &lt;item xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;27999123134&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/to&gt;&lt;from xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;me&lt;/from&gt; &lt;text xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"&gt;Initial test message&lt;/text&gt; &lt;concat xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;deliv_ack xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;callback xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;deliv_time xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;max_credits xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:float\"/&gt; &lt;req_feat xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;queue xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;escalate xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;mo xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;cliMsgId xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;unicode xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;msg_type xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;udh xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;data xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:string\"/&gt; &lt;validity xsi:nil=\"true\" xsi:type=\"xsd:int\"/&gt; &lt;/tns:sendmsg&gt;&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt; &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt; COM: oSMS.SendSimpleSMS API_ID, \"username\", \"password\", \"278…\", \"My first SMS\" NETWORKS AND COUNTRIES Do they support the mobile networks that the majority of my customers are on? Only US or entire world? Clickatells’ Small Business API supports all the major mobile networks in the US, including AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile, so you shouldn’t have any concerns when targeting US customers. It also supports Canada, Latin America and China. I’m unfamiliar with non-US networks, so be sure to scroll to the bottom of the Pricing and Coverage to page to make sure your target customer’s network is listed. PERFORMANCE What is the typical response time of the endpoint? Clickatell claims that each SMS submission takes less than a second and it appears to be very fast in my initial tests. Definitely fast enough for the average small business. PLATFORM SUPPORT Do they support .NET and JavaScript calls? Clickatell’s Small Business API provides you with 4 ways to implement SMS functionality into your application: HTTP/S, COM, XML and SOAP. They also provide a Connect API that allows you to manage your account (buy credits, create new connections, etc) programmatically. They also supply scripts for PhP, VBScript, C#, VB.NET, Cold Fusion, Oracle and there are libraries for Java, Ruby, Perl and Applescript. See their APIs and Scripts page for more details. I dig into the options in more detail in my second post: &quot;How to integrate Clickatell’s SMS Small Business API into a .NET application&quot; TECHNICAL SUPPORT What is response time for technical support inquires? Is there a phone number to call if needed? Clickatell offers email support with a 1 day turnaround time, phone support if you need immediate assistance and they also offer chat on their website. I haven’t had the opportunity to contact their support, but at least they have multiple options with prompt turnaround times. You can find all the ways to contact them at the Clickatell’s Contact Us page. AVAILABILITY How many nines? Do they have downtime notifications? Clickatell’s Small Business API supports 99.99% uptime availability which equates to them being unavailable for 1.01 minute a week, 4.32 minutes a month and 52.56 minutes a year. This is much higher than I expected and should meet all the needs of small businesses. PRICING How much does it cost per message? The pricing information I found on Clickatell Small Business API Pricing page seemed pretty reasonable at .7 to 2 cents per message (depending on what plan you select). One thing to note is that they don’t charge for “mobile to server” (i.e. incoming) messages, whereas other companies do. RATE LIMITING _How much do they throttle messages? _ With the Small Business API you are limited to 10 messages a second, 5k messages a day and 10k messages a month. Their backend will queue messages so you should be able to exceed 10 messages a second, but just be cautious and check for rate limiting status codes if you need to send in bulk. These numbers sound reasonable for small businesses and is based on a research study that Clickatell conducted themselves over a 10 year period. Give them a call if you think you’ll need more than 10k/month. You’ll likely need multiple accounts or you’ll want to upgrade to a different solution. MEDIA Does it support MMS? Clickatell’s Small Business API does not support MMS. CLOSING THOUGHTS Clickatell’s Small Business API is a great choice if: You need to send less than 10k messages a month Your target country and network is supported You don’t need MMS All the other aspects of my research checked out. They appear to have great support, the performance and availability numbers look great and the pricing looks competitive.

We saw a lot of great talent come through, but one of the more memorable performances was from Kris Orlowski. Kris captured our attention because he has a natural charisma that takes you in and captures all your senses. At that first gig back in 2006 every wanna-be musician (including myself) asked if they could open for him someday. The good thing for me was that I was in the concert organization business, so I could choose the lineup. So who do you think I chose for the Kris’s opening act? Yep, my band, twice. It was an awesome experience to open for him and I hope the opportunity comes up again someday. At the time he sounded very much like John Mayer did back then. I like Mayer, but Mayer should be Mayer and everyone else should be themselves. Since then, Kris has found his own unique voice like Dylan or Cash – you just know it is them when you hear one of their tunes. Now when I hear Kris I know it’s him. Whether I’m at the gym or the grocery store I hear his voice on the radio and say to myself…hey that’s Kris. There’s this great quote from Glen Hansard (skip ahead to 5:05) that applies to Kris…“You don’t really earn your voice until at least your mid-thirties…if you are a singer you are kind of copying all the way through your whole life and then at some point you get a voice…if you’re good…and if serve your music correctly”. I don’t know how old Kris is, but the point is that he has served his music and has earned his voice. Every musician, especially a busker, has to copy to get started. The biggest risk for musicians early in their career is that they fall into the trap of sounding “just like” another musician. It’s nice when someone says you sound like someone else, but it’s better to be “compared” to other musicians based on their talent, not sound. I believe that Kris recognized this early on and has worked very hard to develop his own sound….one of the hardest things to do as a musician. Kris is literally one of the hardest working musicians I’ve ever known…constantly writing, recording and performing in endless band configurations. I’ve seen him do small café gigs to huge festivals…I’m not sure how many dates he’s played, but I’m guessing at least 100 a year. He has a true commitment to his music. Kris’s latest album is with Andrew Joslyn, the Seattle based composer, orchestrator and violinist. It’s a 5 song EP that was released yesterday called Pieces We Are, and it is already #13 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter charts. The first thing I was blown away by was the sound quality. When the strings come in at the top of All My People Go my first thought was…man I just played the wrong album because I hadn’t heard such amazing orchestration and sound quality from Kris before. I double checked and indeed I was playing the right album. Kris has really stepped it up with this release in so many ways. The second thing I noticed was Kris’s voice has really matured. Back in 2006 he mostly used his chest voice, which is beautiful, but now I can hear him using his full voice. His head voice is very strong, accurate and emotive. You can hear what I mean at 2:33 of All My People Go or 0:51 in I Will Go. Quite beautiful. Similar to what Bon Iver would do, but not a copy, you still hear Kris’s rich timbre. You don’t hear enough poetry in today’s music. It’s mostly psycho-babble, but it’s different with Kris. There’s an urgency…a sense of wandering…seeking…a journey…a hope…in his words. There’s meat in there that you can think on. Just listen to Mountains. Another thing that is missing from today’s music is tension and release, which to me is the core of composition. For music to be satisfying to me it has to have tension, but that tension has to be released. Musicians have so many tools to do so, from volume to intensity to tonality to instrumentation. My desire for tension and release is 100% satisfied with this album. I’m brought into so many different places in every tune. It is creative, unique, imaginative…memorable. Partnering with Andrew Joslyn was a great call. Kris has great songwriting chops and they are complemented by Andrew’s orchestration and string chops. Really a great pair. I really hope they keep working together and hope they bring this sound to the stage. The cool thing is that listening to this album makes me want to hear what Kris has in store for his next album. I know it will be beautiful, different and even better than yesterday’s release. You can find Pieces We Are on iTunes and Spotify. Check it out. You’ll be glad you did.

I ultimately decided to go with the Telerik Kendo UI ComboBox, because it supports the features I needed out of the box, is free, has an MVC helper and a NuGet package. (The KendoUI ComboBox) I found Hyjack Select and Chosen, but they aren’t true ComboBoxes. A ComboBox must allow you to select an item from a dropdown AND enter in a new item, both Hyjack and Chosen do not allow you to do that without customization. I also found a bunch more on GitHub by just searching for ‘jquery combobox’. I poked around at a few of them, but I found myself going down too many paths and wasting a lot of time. I then stumbled upon the new Kendo UI controls by Telerik and discovered that they have a jQuery ComboBox with an MVC Html Helper, a NuGet package and best of all it is open source (GPL v3). I’ve been using Telerik controls for many years, so I’m used to the high-quality products they dev. Most of the other options I looked at were dev’d by one guy and didn’t have any kind of support. The free version Kendo UI doesn’t come with support, but they do have forums that are pretty active. Save yourself some time and just go with the Kendo UI ComboBox.

Intel wanted to get a pre-production Ultrabook in the hands of a few devs so they can dev with it and give some feedback on what development would look like when we have all those sensors at our fingertips. I’m somewhat new to sensor focused development, but I know that I will be considering how I can use them in every app that I build from here on out. Determining the users location, determining distance of movements, supporting touch screen are all capabilities that we can design for from now on. I’m not suggesting that we build just for the coolness factor, but if the sensors make the app easier to use or make the user more productive then I’m all for it. Being the career web dev that I am I first thought I would have little use for those sensors and even less demand for features that require those sensors. My limited exposure to sensors was back when I was in Bing Mobile, where I added turn by turn navigation to Windows Mobile 6.x. So that’s the first application I thought of when considering what I could do with all the new Windows 8 sensors. I could see someone rewriting a turn-by-turn navigation application with full sensor support. Instead of just using GPS to find the user’s location, they could use the accelerometer, gyro meter and magnometer to build a full functional app that simulates driving through the Bing Streetside maps. Bing does support Bing “Map Apps” and all you need to build a Windows 8 app is the Windows 8 SDK and .NET 4.5. So it should work. You could also host the Bing map application inside of a Windows 8 application and control the Streetside experience using events triggered by the sensors. You can learn more about all the sensor support that is included with Windows 8 from the “Supporting sensors in Windows 8” blog post written by Sinofsky. Intel isn’t ever going to mass produce these Ultrabooks, they just built them as a prototype to show other manufacturers what can be done with Intel components. The biggest barrier that I see hardware manufacturers overcoming is the fact that every developer has spent a ton of time perfecting their workstation and the Ultrabook doesn’t easily fit into that space. We spend very long stretches of time at our dev machines and need something that is comfortable and not going to kill our bodies. The number one problem is that this Ultrabook doesn’t support a docking station. You’d therefore need to connect and disconnect every time you want to dev for any length of time. My normal machine is a Lenovo W510. It’s big, it’s heavy, but it’s a great dev machine. I have a docking station at work and a docking station at home, each of them have 2 monitors, a wired connection and a ton of USB devices (hard drives, headset, digital audio interface, etc). I just undock, throw it in my bag, drive to work, grab out of my bag and re-dock. I also dock and undock all the time throughout the day, mostly just to grab a focus room to do an interview or triage or whatever. It only takes a few seconds to dock and undock and I can’t imagine connecting and reconnecting all the components it all the time. Something to consider when considering an Ultrabook for your development needs is the number of USB and mini-HDMI ports. Some models that I’ve seen only come with a few of each, so just make sure there’s enough to meet your needs including all your peripherals and multi-monitor configurations. For an Ultrabook to be a real dev machine it is going to need the following: Docking station support with at least 8 USB 3.0 ports and multi-monitor support Network adapter for wired connections An amazing keyboard and trackpad. We spend so much time on those two components that it is going to be crucial they are perfected. If you get an Ultrabook without the above then you could make it work by getting the following: A EVGA UV Plus+ to connect an additional monitor via USB A mini-HDMI to DVI connector to connect an additional monitor via the mini-HDMI port A USB hub so you can connect all your peripherals. You could also go with an external Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. But you’ll still need a USB hub if you are going to connect all your external drives, headset, etc. Ultrabooks with robust sensors are going to be the norm for Windows users, especially with Surface RT coming out soon and the native sensor support in the new Windows 8 SDK. What Intel is trying to do is combine the Ultrabook with all the sensor support and the normal development environment. That is going to be a difficult thing to sell without docking station support. Every dev I know either uses a desktop or has multiple docking stations. I know some Ultrabook manufacturers have included support for docking stations, which is what devs will gravitate towards. I would be completely sold on this Ultrabook if I could use it both as a lightweight machine that I could dev Windows 8 apps on and a pure dev machine that I could run 4 instances of Visual Studio on and snap it into my docking station. It’s fast, the touch screen is great and it’s a lot lighter than my Lenovo, but at this point I would take one heavy machine that I can get my full dev setup on over a light machine that I have to constantly connect and disconnect. I will continue to use the Ultrabook over the next couple of months and will let you know how it fares after daily usage. Thx! Jon title: First look at the Intel IvyBridge Ultrabook tags: review visual studio categories: [Tech, Reviews] alias: 2012/09/intel-ivybridge-ultrabook-first-look.html date: 2012-09-27 20:32:00 Intel just sent me an IvyBridge Ultrabook to try out and review as a development machine. It’s not a final machine and won’t ever be sold by Intel. The main purpose of the machine is to show what can be built with Windows 8 and Intel components. To do so, it comes with sensors including: 5 point multi-touch screen accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope ambient light sensor GPS NFC I’m not sure how I’m going to integrate the usage of these sensors into web dev, but I can definitely see an opportunity with mobile apps. I have had a lot of opportunity to play with other Ultrabooks on the market, so I was surprised that it wasn’t as thin and light as the others. Yes, it is a pre-production machine that will never be on the market, but they haven’t quite hit the mark with size and portability yet. It shipped with a non-RTM version of Windows 8, so the first thing I did was install RTM on it. The OS installed quickly as did Office and Visual Studio. I was up and running with my normal tools in a couple of hours. I haven’t done any real dev on this machine, but from what I’ve seen so far, it is fast. Switching apps, moving around Windows, using Office and IE are all instantaneous. I’m very curious to see how this thing does with 5 instances of Visual Studio and Resharper. My gut is that 4GB of RAM isn’t going to scale since each instance of VS usually takes about 500MB in resting state. They are definitely going to need to ship these with more RAM if they are to be considered a true dev machine. I personally can’t use any laptop trackpad and keyboard for very long, but the trackpad and keyboard that ships with it is a little more difficult to use than other Ultrabooks I’ve used. I definitely need to figure out a way to set this up to work with my normal mouse and keyboard and multi-monitors. I’ll do more in-depth reviews in the weeks to follow.

This post is a great example of that perk. The EF team has been amazing, especially Rowan Miller and Diego Vega. Always very positive and eager to help out. This post is about my research into a question that has always been lingering in the back of my mind…. **“Should I always call Dispose() on my DbContext objects?” ** Before I talked with the devs on the EF team my answer was always a resounding “of course!”. But it’s not true with DbContext. You don’t need to be religious about calling Dispose on your DbContext objects. Even though it does implement IDisposable, it only implements it so you can call Dispose as a safeguard in some special cases. By default DbContext automatically manages the connection for you. Read to the end to hear the full story and see what the EF devs had to say about it. (Showing that DbContext implements IDisposable) I started the conversation with the EF team by proclaiming that the industry needs to stop teaching people to use DbContext objects as private members without disposing of them properly. Rowan Miller’s first response, was that yes, we do encourage it and try to make sure we dispose of all our DbContext objects anytime we have a demo or sample code. So I thought “yes, I’m right!” let me code up an example that demonstrates to my blog readers the difference calling Dispose makes to our User Connections count. So I setup perfmon to monitor User Connections and ran the sample below. I was surprised to see that the User Connection numbers were exactly the same. I didn’t matter if I called Dispose or not! static void Main(string[] args) &#123; bool useUsing = args.Length == 0 || bool.Parse(args[0]); Call(useUsing); &#125; private static void Call(bool useUsing) &#123; for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5000; i++) &#123; if (useUsing) &#123; using (var db = new DbContextUsingTestEntities()) &#123; CallInternal(db); &#125; &#125; else &#123; var db = new DbContextUsingTestEntities(); CallInternal(db); &#125; &#125; &#125; private static void CallInternal(DbContextUsingTestEntities db) &#123; var data = from d in db.Data select d; foreach (var datum in data) &#123; Console.WriteLine(string.Concat(datum.Id, \":\", datum.Name)); &#125; &#125; So I pinged Rowan again with my code snippet to see if they had any other code samples that accurately demonstrated the effect on User Connections. In the meantime I was watching the MVC4 PluralSight course and saw Scott Allen use a DbContext object without calling Dispose. I thought, man I totally respect Scott Allen and if he’s not calling Dispose then something must be wrong with my thinking, so I sent this along to Rowan as well. Rowan forwarded my mail to Diego Vega (the Senior SDE Lead on EF) and here is his response Hello Jon, The default behavior of DbContext is that the underlying connection is automatically opened any time is needed and closed when it is no longer needed. E.g. when you execute a query and iterate over query results using \"foreach\", the call to IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.GetEnumerator() will cause the connection to be opened, and when later there are no more results available, \"foreach\" will take care of calling Dispose on the enumerator, which will close the connection. In a similar way, a call to DbContext.SaveChanges() will open the connection before sending changes to the database and will close it before returning. Given this default behavior, in many real-world cases it is harmless to leave the context without disposing it and just rely on garbage collection. That said, there are two main reason our sample code tends to always use \"using\" or dispose the context in some other way: 1\\. The default automatic open/close behavior is relatively easy to override: you can assume control of when the connection is opened and closed by manually opening the connection. Once you start doing this in some part of your code, then forgetting to dipose the context becomes harmful, because you might be leaking open connections. 2\\. DbContext implements IDiposable following the recommended pattern, which includes exposing a virtual protected Dispose method that derived types can override if for example the need to aggregate other unmanaged resources into the lifetime of the context. _By the way, with DbContext the pattern to open the connection manually and override the automatic open/close behavior is a bit awkward:_ _((IObjectContextAdapter)dbContext).ObjectContext.Connection.Open()_ _But we have a bug to make this easier as it used to be with ObjectContext before, e.g.:_ _ dbContext.Database.Connection.Open()_ Hope this helps, Diego So there you have it. DbContext manages the underlying connection for you. You can call Dispose, but in most common scenarios you don’t need to. I’m old school, so I still call Dispose, but it’s great knowing for sure that you don’t have to. Hope this helps those who were curious about why you don’t see people calling Dispose or using the using statement all the time. Maybe it is out of laziness, but at least EF has them covered.

If you go to the “Upgrade your Mac” page on Apple.com they tell you how to upgrade “right from your mac” but they don’t tell you how to upgrade if you don’t have the App Store installed. I just went through a little bit of pain to get my MacBook Pro upgraded from Leopard (10.5.8) to Mountain Lion (10.8) so I thought I’d put together a series of posts to save you some time. Here are some things I learned while upgrading: 1. The App Store was introduced in the Snow Leopard (10.6.6) update. From there you can install OS X directly from the App Store. 2. You can only get to Lion or Mountain Lion via Snow Leopard, you can’t go from Leopard to Mountain Lion directly. 3. It costs $20 to upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard and another $20 to go from Snow Leopard to Lion or Mountain Lion. You’ll find all versions online somewhere (Amazon, eBay, etc) but they are double or triple the price. Just order from Apple directly to have piece of mind about what you are getting and the lowest price. 4. Calling Apple directly at 1-800-MY-APPLE (1-800-692-7753) is very helpful. Very little wait time and they are more knowledgeable then calling your local Apple store. Maybe they are considered “super geniuses”? :) 5. Mountain Lion doesn’t really have any features that I need. AirPlay isn’t supported on my MacBook Pro version (too old), Power Nap, Dictation and Game Center….all not interested in. So just make sure you want to upgrade for those features before you spend the $20 now. If you can upgrade to Mountain Lion now, maybe you should just wait until the new version of OS X comes out. 6. The Snow Leopard DVDs are only available by calling Apple. You can’t buy in your local store. 7. The Lion upgrade isn’t available on the App Store any more. You need to call Apple to purchase and they’ll send you an email with a link to download Lion.

If you don’t have the “App Store…” menu item then click on the “Software Update…” menu item. 3. This will launch the Software Update dialog. Once the dialog completely loads, look for an item called “Mac OS X Update Combined”. That is the OS X update that includes the App Store, so go ahead and install that. It took about 30 minutes for me. 4. After the install is complete click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen. You should now see the “App Store…” menu item.

It’s not a final machine and won’t ever be sold by Intel. The main purpose of the machine is to show what can be built with Windows 8 and Intel components. To do so, it comes with sensors including: 5 point multi-touch screen accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope ambient light sensor GPS NFC I’m not sure how I’m going to integrate the usage of these sensors into web dev, but I can definitely see an opportunity with mobile apps. I have had a lot of opportunity to play with other Ultrabooks on the market, so I was surprised that it wasn’t as thin and light as the others. Yes, it is a pre-production machine that will never be on the market, but they haven’t quite hit the mark with size and portability yet. It shipped with a non-RTM version of Windows 8, so the first thing I did was install RTM on it. The OS installed quickly as did Office and Visual Studio. I was up and running with my normal tools in a couple of hours. I haven’t done any real dev on this machine, but from what I’ve seen so far, it is fast. Switching apps, moving around Windows, using Office and IE are all instantaneous. I’m very curious to see how this thing does with 5 instances of Visual Studio and Resharper. My gut is that 4GB of RAM isn’t going to scale since each instance of VS usually takes about 500MB in resting state. They are definitely going to need to ship these with more RAM if they are to be considered a true dev machine. I personally can’t use any laptop trackpad and keyboard for very long, but the trackpad and keyboard that ships with it is a little more difficult to use than other Ultrabooks I’ve used. I definitely need to figure out a way to set this up to work with my normal mouse and keyboard and multi-monitors. I’ll do more in-depth reviews in the weeks to follow. Jon Disclosure of Material Connection: Like I mentioned above, Intel sent me the Ultrabook and are letting me keep the device so I can continue to give them feedback on it as a dev machine. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: &quot;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Reviews","slug":"Tech/Reviews","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Reviews/"}],"tags":[{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/review/"},{"name":"visual studio","slug":"visual-studio","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/tags/visual-studio/"}]},{"title":"Don't fall for the \"lol wat r you doing n this video\" or the \"heh u didnt see  them tapping u\" phishing scam on Twitter","slug":"beware-of-twitter-phishing-attacks","date":"2012-09-27T05:06:00.000Z","updated":"2018-12-10T22:25:39.434Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/09/beware-of-twitter-phishing-attacks/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2012/09/beware-of-twitter-phishing-attacks/","excerpt":"","text":"I recently received two Twitter direct messages from new followers. They were obviously phishing attacks that happened as a result of the followers account being hacked. The messages were “lol wat r you doing n this video” and “heh u didnt see them tapping u” and contained links back to app on Facebook. What ever you do don’t click on the link in that direct message and don’t enter your Twitter credentials into the app that it redirects to on Facebook.com. The link in the phishing attack redirects to this app on Facebook, which prompts you for your Twitter credentials.The page looks legit enough, but the first sign of a phishing attack is when they ask you for your credentials for another site. Facebook will never ask you for your Twitter credentials or any other site credentials for that matter. For those interested, Facebook uses OATH 2.0 for authentication and authorization, not embedded login pages. (The Facebook.com page that the phishing attack redirects to) Once the app has your credentials it hacks into your Twitter account and sends the same direct message that you got to all your followers. I’m not sure what else it does, but from that point on it has your Twitter credentials (until you change your password). Because many people use the same password for multiple sites it will probably get your email address and try to hack into your email as well. Another hint that it is an attack is that the Facebook app doesn’t have an official name as you can see in the browser title bar. The title bar shows 12426907 on Facebook. “12426907” is the name of the App. That means that the person who created the app just used the default name or dumped some numbers in there to further obfuscate the attack. The links on the apps pages post to this URL: lmaotweekdeck which returns a 404 if you hit it directly and you get a dummy page if you load lmoatweetdeck.info. The WHOIS record for lmaotweetdeck.info belongs to a guy in Miami, FL, not a corporation. Another sign that the direct message is a phishing attack. Twitter’s API does allow you to make requests on behalf of users, but I personally would never enter my credentials for any site other than the originating site or a site I am 100% confident that it is legit.

The truth is that I dev iPhone apps and you can only do that on a Mac. I still love Microsoft and Windows, but you got to do what you got to do. The short and sweet version of this post… Call 1-800-MY-APPLE (1-800-692-7753) and order Snow Leopard from Apple directly for $19.99. It’s now longer available from the Apple online store and any other place with cost you at least $56. The long-winded dramatic version of this post… A user recently reported a bug in my Unstar All Google Reader™ Starred Items Extension on Mountain Lion with Chrome Beta. My old MacBook Pro only has 10.5.8 on it and the latest version of Chrome beta isn’t compatible with 10.5.8, so I couldn’t test my Chrome extension. So I set out to upgrade from 10.5.8 to Mountain Lion. The Apple upgrade page doesn’t mention anything about how to go from 10.5.8 to Mountain Lion, so I called my local Bellevue Apple Store. They said I need to first upgrade to Snow Leopard, then Lion then Mountain Lion. To go from 10.5.8 to Snow Leopard you need the install DVDs and then from there you can upgrade via downloads. I tried to upgrade using a MacMini OS Install disk, but that didn’t work because that can only be used to restore an OS on a MacMini, not an OS install on a MacBook Pro. To do the upgrade I need a generic Snow Leopard install DVD. The only problem is that the local store doesn’t carry the Snow Leopard DVDs anymore, so they recommended I go to the Apple online store to purchase the DVD. I searched for Snow Leopard on the Apple online store and didn’t find anything, so I called the store back. They also couldn’t find it online so they recommended I buy it from Amazon.com or eBay. I searched online and found the Snow Leopard DVDs, but they start at $65 at Amazon.com and $56 on eBay. I knew the original Snow Leopard DVDs sold for $29.99 and I wasn’t about to pay double, so I called the store back. The store recommended that I call 1-800-MY-APPLE (1-800-692-7753) to order the DVDs directly. I just got off the phone with them after purchasing the Snow Leopard DVDs for $19.99. So, just do yourself a favor, save some time, skip eBay, skip Amazon and just call Apple directly. I’ll have my disk in a few days and I’ll do another post on how to go from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.

I’ve been at Microsoft for 8 years now and while I’ve been able to order any hardware I need (with a good reason) this recent give away is by far the most extravagant I have seen. Yes, our best advocates are our employees using our hardware and software and Microsoft totally gets that. I would have been happy with 25-50% off, so to just give it away is awesome. Last year we all got a Windows Phone 7 for free which was really the first time I witnessed mass giveaways, other than at conferences. I’m hoping the trend continues and we all get a Windows Phone 9 when it comes out. Free hardware is another amazing perk about being a Microsoftie.

Most conference sites don’t provide an easy way to do so, which led me to create a quick console app back in July for aspConf. Based on the speaker names, the app will find the speaker blog, blog feeds and twitter accounts. It then generates and OPML file and Twitter list to allow other devs to easily subscribe to blogs and follow on Twitter. Since then, I’ve been working on converting that to a web app to help me collect all the data.

is a post in a blog series I’m writing called &quot;Microsoftie Perks&quot; Over the years I have found many bugs in Microsoft products. I want to help Microsoft have the best products out there, so I take the time to file bugs or talk with the product teams about the issues. They are always very cool about it by connecting me with the dev who wrote the feature to help me diagnose the issue and sometimes spending hours with me. The most recent example is when I found a bug in the Visual Studio Extension manager when trying to update NuGet. I pinged Howard Dierking, not that he has anything to do with the Extension Manager per se, but I know he runs NuGet and would probably be interested in solving the issue. Within the next couple of days I heard from Jitendra Kumar, a dev on the Extension Manager. He couldn’t repro the issue locally, so he wanted me to share my desktop so he could see the issue. He took control of my machine, loaded the symbols for the Extension Manager, stepped through the code and found the offending line of code. It was pretty awesome to him at work. Here’s a screenshot I took while he was debugging the issue. (Click it to see a larger version) That is just one small example. I’ve worked with so many product teams over the years including TFS, Office, BizTalk, SQL, Visual Studio, you name it and I bet I have been helped by them. This is obviously an amazing perk of working at Microsoft. Especially as a dev. Imagine the thing that annoys you the most about a product or a bug that is blocking you from your work. Yes, you can get support if you work for another company. But man, being a Microsoftie and being able to IM the dev who coded that feature. That is awesome.

The best help I could find was this post in the Chromium Apps Google Group, but it still took me a few minutes to figure it out, which IMO is something to blog about. Here’s how to include the trademark symbol in your chrome extension name: 1. Install Notepad++ or any other text editor that allows you to change the encoding to UTF-8. 2. Open your manifest.json file in NotePad++ 3. Go to the Encoding menu and select UTF-8. 4. Put your cursor at the position where you want to insert the trademark symbol. 5.

This isn’t a sponsored post, I just like how they function as a company and I hope I can save you some time and stress when you have brake issues. Most brake repair places say they offer “FREE” brake inspections, but what they don’t tell you upfront is that they aren’t truly free…it’s more like a credit towards future work. They just take the cost of the inspection off the brake repair if you get work done with them. If you don’t, then you owe them for the inspection, which could be around $30. I got sucked into a “FREE” brake inspection promise recently. I assumed that FREE meant FREE, so I just pulled my car in and asked for an inspection without thinking I’d be charged. While I was waiting for the inspection to be completed I called around to see if I could get a better repair price. I did find a better price…about $200 better. I thought I was going to be able to grab my car and go to the other place to get the work done. Nope. The place charged me $30 for the inspection because I didn’t get the work done on the spot. I use Facebook all the time to get recommendations and asked about brakes. My friend recommended Les Schwab. It was a great recommendation. I got my brakes inspected and repaired there and I will always go back for two reasons: Their brake inspections are truly free. They don’t require you to do service after. You just walk in, get your brakes inspected and walk out with no money exchange and no pressure to get the work done then. Meineke offers a FREE visual check, but they will charge you if “diagnostic” services are required. Not so with Les Schwab. I trust them. After I got my brakes fixed, I noticed a ticking sound coming from my tires so I brought it back in to Les Schwab. The tech could have told me anything…different part was bad or whatever, but he didn’t. He told me he did something wrong the first time and was going to fix everything and not charge me. That is obviously the right thing to do, but most places wouldn’t be that honest about screwing up. So give them a shot. At least get an inspection so you can see what I’m talking about. I get an inspection and rotate my tires there about every 10k miles.

That is pretty amazing considering there are hundreds of buildings and thousands of employees that request books all the time. When I’m done with the book, I just drop it off in my building’s mail room. I have probably requested hundreds of books and DVDs over the years and am extremely happy with the service.

I’ve put in many requests over the years and only a handful have been denied because the electronic version was already available. Microsoft also teamed up with a digital book service that allows us to read almost any technical book from any computer or phone. There are a ton of other resources as well like free subscriptions to Cutter, Economist, Forbes, Fortune, Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal and a ton more.

The biggest beef I have with it is that the models can get out of sync with the database and saving the EDMX file and running the “Update Model from Database…” feature doesn’t work. (The Update Model from Database option doesn’t update the object model and class files) For example, let’s say I start with this model: And I add a new table to the DB called Foo: I then go back to my app and add my new table to the model using the “Update Model from Database…” feature: And it is added to the diagram: But the corresponding object model and CS file wasn’t generated: Up until today I would have recreated the EDMX file, which is a big pain. But I discovered that there’s a context menu item called “Run Custom Tool”. The most obvious choice is to select “Run Custom Tool” from the EDMX file, but that doesn’t do anything: If you F4 the corresponding T4 file you can see that the custom tool associated with the T4 file is: TextTemplatingFileGenerator So, I selected “Run Custom Tool” from the T4 context menu: And that generated the Foo.cs file: But I still didn’t have the Foo class in my object model: So I selected the “Run Custom Tool” on the tt file: And that generated the correct object model: So anytime you find your EF model and/or class files out of sync with your database then you need to manually run the “Run Custom Tool” command on both the [Entities].tt file and the [Entities].Context.tt file. This is a big pain. I will ping the product team to see if they can run the custom tool on the EDMX file when it is saved and recursively run on all the tt files associated with that EDMX parent.

About 35,000 Microsofties raised $100.5 million in 2011! Microsoft encourages Microsofties to be generous by matching our charitable gifts of cash, volunteer time, stock or product dollar for dollar, up to $12,000 a year, with cash or Microsoft products. There is an internal site called “give” that allows you to enter your gifts and Microsoft takes it from there to verify the gift with the organization and do that match. The Giving Campaign A lot of this giving happens during the Giving Campaign, which is a fund raising event that happens once a year to encourage Microsofties to give and to enter their giving to be matched. There are so many activities that happen during this time to help raise money, like the 5k race (which I have been training for for the last couple of months), an auction, concerts and other community led events. I have personally been involved with the Giving CD and the Giving Photobook and have put on a few concerts to support Northwest Harvest and Seattle Red Cross. It’s a great experience and also very humbling to know that there are so many people in need. But also very nice to see how actively Microsoft is involved and supportive of the causes that Microsofties care about. Triple Matching You should also be on the look out for special programs with silent matchers to triple your contributions. For example, right now the Seattle’s Union Gospel Mission is having a shortfall in giving and someone stepped forward to match dollar for dollar up to $5,000. Include that with Microsoft’s matching program and your $19.20 becomes $38.40 which becomes $57.6 or about 30 meals. This Microsoft perk is an amazing one that means a lot to me. It’s such a great thing to know your charity will actually get double what you give, $12,000 turns into $24,000. Imagine what your charity could do with an extra $12,000.

Whether I’m looking for money for charity events, providing feedback on products within their org or providing feedback on the café food…they always take the time to respond. Earlier this year I sent a quick email to Lisa Brummel (Chief People Officer) asking why Microsoft cafés can’t be better. She responded very positively, CC’d some people to have a look and we saw immediate change. I also recently pinged Scott Guthrie (@scottgu) (VP of Azure) about some issues I saw with Azure and it looks like the team is already in the process of fixing those issues. I’ve actually pinged him many times since 2003 and he’s always very cool about…even when I wasn’t a Microsoftie! Brian Harry (@bharry) (Technical Fellow, TFS) hears from me a lot because I do so much with TFS. He always responds within an hour or so, always very helpful. I have an idea what it is like to be an exec. They are busy. They are in meetings most of the day making important decisions. So, I wonder if getting an email from a dev lead like me is refreshing for them…maybe they respond right away because it brings them back to their tech roots, maybe they are love what they do and want to help see it succeed. Whatever it is I like it and it is one of my favorite Microsoftie perks. I get answers I need and see results from the people at the top. And of course there are the folks that aren’t execs, but are also very responsive when they have no obligation to be. Scott Hanselman (Community Architect, @shanselman), Howard Dierking (NuGetPM, @howard_dierking), Nikhil Kothari (Architect, @nikhilk), Stephen Toub and many more…they are all very cool about responding to all my questions. Having this type of communication chain with key decision makers and influencers in the company is an amazing thing. They don’t have to respond. They could just ignore. But they don’t. They listen to the people and make stuff happen.

Dogfood, or “eating your own dog food” simply means that we use and test out software before we release it to the public to help increase the quality of the product by providing feedback to the product teams. Yes, other companies do it too, but it really nice to be able to dogfood your new IDE, Office or whatever you use every day all day. For example, my team and I have been using Visual Studio 2012 for months now and will be one of the first to completely transition our entire code base to it…we actually plan to do that this coming Monday! I don’t exactly remember every product I’ve dogfooded, but I do remember being on Vista, BizTalk, SQL Server, Visual Studio, TFS (before it was even announced) … the list goes on and on. It’s really easy to find the dogfood too. If you want to install the latest OS just hit F12 when you boot your machine and boot from the network. If you want to install any other software you can either go to an internal site called “products” or go to the respective sharepoint team site “devdiv” “office” etc. Very easy to find and usually very easy to install. There also another cool program called Technology Adoption Program (TAP), also available to external customers, which allows you to get the latest bits AND get direct help from the product team. I’ve done this for BizTalk, SQL Server and Velocity. It was awesome. The product team assign a person, usually a PM, to work directly with your team. They answer questions, give you QFEs and collect your feedback. I’ve seen many of my teams suggestions get into products…it’s very rewarding. When you do go about dogfooding something, especially your main dev env I recommend doing so on a VM. There’s too much risk in installing on your main machine, especially when the dogfood is in its early stages. I’ve been burned a few times by installing VS when it was too early on my dev machine and later regretting it when I had to spend hours trying to uninstall or just ultimately flattening the box. Trust me. Use a VM :) I’m looking forward to Monday. My team will officially be on Visual Studio 2012 and MVC4…way before most of the world will.

We’ve been sending emails back and forth that go something like this: “Check this one out: http://www.kentwoodfloors.com/us/originals/products/30302” Just a URL, no associated product name. The problem is that Kentwood changed their URL scheme and didn’t provide any means of getting from the old URL to the new URL. I really like their new URL scheme…instead of product code or db key they are using the product name instead. It’s clean, RESTful and memorable, but the way they handled the change was deplorable. My goal was to find the new URLs for the hardwood floors I liked, but uncovered some very painful mistakes they made when they changed their URLs. Please read, comment, but don’t repeat these mistakes UPDATE: 8/4/2012 I emailed KentwoodFloors.com right after I wrote this post and it looks like they are fixing a bunch of these issues! See my “UPDATE” text inline to see what has been fixed. Mistake #1: No automatic URL redirection I opened up the email thread I was having with my wife again this morning, clicked on the link and got a “page not found” error. Most users at this point are dead in the water. Their first thought would probably be that the hardwood isn’t available anymore or they would call Kentwood to ask about it. Problem: You change your product URLs and show generic error messages that leave users at a dead end. Solution: Always provide automatic URL redirection from old to new when changing URL schemes. Research 301 redirects and do it. UPDATE: 8/4/2012 – They redirect to the homepage now instead of returning a 404. Not any better IMO. They really need to redirect to the new product URL Mistake #2: Product codes not indexed I grabbed what I thought was the product code from the URL, 30302 and entered that into the search box. No results. Problem: Technical users will visually parse your URL to find some resemblance of a code or product name and site your site using what they find. Your site search returns no results. Solution: Always index your product codes (or db keys) so users can find the products by that key through site search Mistake #3: Search Engine Index Not Updated At this point there is nothing more that KentwoodFloors.com can offer me. I can’t find the product and there’s no way to do so, without the hardwood name. So I have to resort to other sites. I’m not sure how many users know this, but search engines allow you to scope your search to specific websites. If you specific the keyword “site” in your search, the search engine will only search that site. For example, to search for “TFS” on my blog you would enter “site:blog.jongallant.com tfs” http://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3Ablog.jongallant.com+tfs&amp;go=&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;pq=site%3Ablog.jongallant.com+tfs&amp;sc=8-27&amp;sp=-1&amp;sk= This is my next option in search of the hardwood floor name. So I went to Bing and searched for the product code 30302 and used KentwoodFloors.com and the site scope. http://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3Akentwoodfloors.com+30302&amp;go=&amp;qs=HS&amp;form=QBRE&amp;pq=site%3Aken&amp;sc=1-8&amp;sp=1&amp;sk= Very cool! It returned a result and the title of the first search result contained the name of the hardwood! At least I now know the name of the hardwood, but the URL that is returned by Bing is still the old one that results in a 404. Bing’s “cached page” feature can help sometimes. It brings up the page as it was the last time Bing.com indexed it, but as you can see below it’s not much help in this case. Problem: The Kentwoodfloors.com site changed its product urls, but didn’t tell search engines to reindex the site. Solution: Use the Bing Webmaster Tools and Google Webmaster Tools to have your site reindexed by them. Also be sure to provide 301 redirects from the old to new URLs. Mistake #4: Product names not indexed I want to find the new URL, so I go back to kentwoodfloors.com and search for Maple Tillamook, but still get no results. Solution: Obvious. Index your own product names UPDATE: 8/4/2012 – They fixed this issue. A search for ‘maple tillamook’ now returns the product: Mistake #5: Advanced Search feature was hard to find From #4 above you can see that I’m at a dead end. It turns out there is an advanced search, but it buried in a different page. I click on “All products” in the left hand nav and just happened to notice “ADVANCED PRODUCT SEARCH” under the hero graphic. See if you can find it. There’s no indication that this is a form or a button, it just looks like a header. Solution: Make your advanced search easy to find and link to it from your normal search results page Mistake #6: Products not index by your own filter categories I hover over it to find that it does pop up an advanced search dialog. Sweet! I can filter by hardwood species and I’m sure to find my Maple Tillamook. I filter by Maple: And Maple results are now shown, but…. NO MAPLE TILLAMOOK!! Solution: Make sure you attribute your products so they appear based on your own advanced search filters. UPDATE: 8/4/2012 – They fixed this issue. Maple Tillamook is now returned when you filter by Maple. Mistake #7: Provide an “ALL PRODUCTS” category that doesn’t contain all your products I’m at a loss at this point, so I go back to “ALL PRODUCTS” thinking it must be returned in that list. Yeah, I have to go through pages and pages of results, but I MUST FIND THIS HARDWOOD!, so I do it. I go through all 8 pages only to find Maple Tillamook NOT LISTED! Solution: If you have an ALL PRODUCTS category, make sure it really includes all your products UPDATE: 8/4/2012 – They fixed this issue. Maple Tillamook is now listed in the all products page. Mistake #8: Make your users search a PDF catalog At this point I’ve exhausted all my resources and ideas, so I poke around the site a little more and find a link to their PDF catalog right under the left hand nav. So I crack that open, do a search for Tillamook and BAM! there it is. Problem: Users have search PDF files to find products. Solution: See all the solutions above Mistake #9: Make users resort to hacking your URL to find the new product URL Okay, so I found the product in the PDF, but that doesn’t help me send a new URL to my wife and I don’t want to search the PDF every time or rely on a screenshot of the wood to compare it will others. I remembered, from my earlier poking around the site, that the new URL schema contains the product name like this: https://kentwoodfloors.com/ca/products/oak-honey I replaced oak-honey with maple-tillamook request the page and wow, I found the new URL! https://kentwoodfloors.com/ca/products/maple-tillamook It only took me a few minutes to find the new URL, but the normal user searching for hardwood flooring isn’t going to be as technical and therefore likely give up a lot sooner. I would immediately fix this if I owned Kentwoodfloors.com. My takeaways: Don’t expect URLs to be permanent. Send product names or screenshots when sending URLs that don’t contain anything in them that describes the product.

The problem is that FeedBurner automatically picks up the post with the short title, which is how it will appear in RSS readers, and doesn’t refresh the feed with the long title for another 30 minutes. After I publish my post for the second time with the long title I use the Feed Burner Ping Service to refresh my FeedBurner feed.

It’s great that C25K supports Pink and I found the app very useful, but it’s not exact in how it calculates distance. I’m glad I was running both apps (C25K for the training plan and MapMyRun for GPS) because with MapMyRun I discovered that C25K includes the 5 minute (~.4 miles) warm-up and cool down in it’s 3.1 mile calculation. So don’t believe C25K when it tells you that you can now run a 5K…you actually only ran 2.3 miles (3.1 miles - .8 miles)…that’s almost a mile less. The fundamental problem is that C25K is strictly time based, not distance based, but real races are the opposite. When you run an actual 5K race it will be for 3.1 miles, so don’t depend on C25K to prepare. Use MapMyRun to get an exact time and distance. I recommend doing the 5 minute (.4 mile) brisk warm-up and cool down regardless, but don’t count it as part of your 3.1 miles. Depending on how fast you walk the final distance will be about 3.6 to 3.9 miles. Now that I can run a 5K I plan on continuing to train for the 10K. I could use the free ZenLabs Couch to 10K Trainer app or I could pay $6/month for the MapMyRun training program, or use on the many other apps in the AppStore. It would be great if C25K modified their app to not include the warm-up and cool down, then I would just keep doing what I’m doing now with running both apps at the same time. For now I’m going to keep running the 5K to get my time down and run a few official races, like the SnoqualmieRun coming up on Aug 18th. Running turns out to be a great time to listen to audiobooks, which you can get for free from your local library. Over the past couple of months I listened to these books while running and commuting…all very good books. Enjoy you time on the road!

You can view the source for HtmlWeb here and see that they expose a PreRequest delegate: public delegate bool PreRequestHandler(HttpWebRequest request); And they call that delegate right before making the GetResponse call: if (PreRequest != null)&#123; // allow our user to change the request at will if (!PreRequest(req)) &#123; return HttpStatusCode.ResetContent; &#125; &#125;HttpWebResponse resp;try&#123; resp = req.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;&#125; So all you have to do is assign a delegate to PreRequest and set your timeout within that delegate: var web = new HtmlWeb();web.PreRequest = delegate(HttpWebRequest webRequest)&#123; webRequest.Timeout = 4; return true;&#125;;var doc = web.Load(\"http://www.msn.com/\"); Yep, it’s that easy.

You write a view and your first inclination is to create a cshtml file called List.cshtml, but that doesn’t work. There’s a trick and it has to do with the way List&lt;Tis expressed as a type in reflection form. You can see this by calling GetType().Name on a List List&lt;string&gt; strings = new List&lt;string&gt;();Console.WriteLine(strings.GetType().Name); As you can see, the reflected name is List`1, NOT List. MVC (by default) will try to map the property to List`1.cshmlt, not List.cshtml. So you have two options. 1. Name your DisplayTemplate List`1.cshtml and let MVC automatically resolve the property template @Html.DisplayFor(m =&gt; ss.Items); 2. Specify a Template Name when calling DisplayFor @Html.DisplayFor(m =&gt; ss.Items, \"Items\"); When you reference the @model in the view use either IList or List or if you know the type at design time then just use that i.e. List My preference is to use option #2 because you’ll likely have many other classes that use List&lt;Tand you’ll likely want to specify a different display template for each of them.

I met some awesome people and decided then that I would work for Microsoft some day. I submitted my resume to the Microsoft careers site so many times, but never heard back. I assumed that since I only had about 2 years of experience back then and no related degree, Microsoft wouldn’t even look at my resume I didn’t know anyone at the company, didn’t have much experience and didn’t have a degree….but still I was determined to work at Microsoft. Since I had already been a college student for 4 years as a music major, I didn’t really want to start over with computer science. So instead I decided to fulfill the “or equivalent work experience” requirement on most Microsoft job postings. I knew it would probably be the same amount of time in school versus getting the hands on work experience, but I already had a web dev job and couldn’t give up the money to go back to school. In 2003, after a couple of years of travelling around the country as an independent web dev and many no-response resume submissions through the Microsoft careers site, I had the idea of just getting my foot in the door by starting as a contractor. So I called up Volt, asked to speak to a manager, told them my situation and they said…“as a matter of fact I do have something that looks like a fit”. I started at Microsoft two weeks later. Dream come true. I realized that Microsoft observes contractors as an extended interview so I pulled out all stops, did my absolute best and was later hired as an FTE. It’s been almost 8 years since then and it has been an awesome experience. I’ve grown so much over the years and have worked with some amazing people. So, what are your options for getting a job at Microsoft? Well, it depends on your situation. Friend at Microsoft? Knowing someone here is obviously the best way to get in. There’s an amazing internal referral system here. If you are reading this blog then you now have a friend at Microsoft. Contact me through this blog to start the conversation. I’m always happy to help good people get into Microsoft. Don’t just send me your resume or a quick note…tell me how I can help you fulfill your dream and what you can do for Microsoft. If you know someone else better at Microsoft, then send them your resume and a couple of job ids from the Microsoft careers site. College Student? The best way to get a job as a college student is to get into a Microsoft internship. I have had many interns on my teams over the years and it’s always amazing to see such great talent coming from the universities. There is no better way to prove yourself than going through a 12 week extended interview. At the end of your internship your manager needs to make a hire or no-hire decision. Do your best and make sure you get a hire. Set very clear goals for your internship and follow up on those goals regularly with your manager. Experienced? Keep your LinkedIn, Monster, StackOverflow and Microsoft careers profile up to date. Microsoft recruiters use these sites to look for talent. Represent yourself well. Start as a contractor. Prove yourself and it will likely lead to a full time job. Most contractor jobs are posted to Monster, Dice, LinkedIn, etc, so just find one that fits and submit your resume. This is how I got in and it worked out great for me. Regardless of your situation you want to make sure you are submitting your resume to specific positions through the Microsoft careers site, because it can’t hurt to do so. Lastly, you can do any of the above and hopefully you can get in, but you must do something that sets you apart from the rest. For me, it was a Microsoft certification, good command of the technology and a concise resume with details on what I did to change the product, not just a list of tasks completed. I’m not sure what that thing is for you, but with all the resumes Microsoft sees you have to have something that helps you stick out. Hope this helps you fulfill your dream of working for Microsoft. Let me know if you have any questions or need help. Jon Related Posts My Thoughts on the Microsoft Career Model - Do I have to get into management to be successful at Microsoft?

Here’s how to move it to the Audiobooks section. When you borrow audiobooks from your library, there are usually two options: MP3 and WMA. I will go for the WMA audiobook if there is an iPod/Apple license because WMA are imported as audiobooks and MP3s are imported as music, but sometimes the only option is MP3. The reason why I don’t like this is because the iPhone doesn’t allow you to play music at double speed and puts the files on a different tab so you have to remember where to go to find each book on your phone. I always listen to books at double speed and want all my books under the same tab….so I need to move it. For this example I downloaded the QBQ! The Question Behind the Question as an MP3 audiobook because that was all that was available. (Great book BTW). I’m going to show you how to get this under the Audiobooks section [ (The audiobook QBQ under the songs section by default) Because iTunes treats MP3 audiobooks as music it when into the “Songs” tab on my iPhone, but I really want it under my “Audiobooks” tab with all my other audiobooks. You can find that by tapping on “More” and then tapping on “Audiobooks” [ (More –&gt; Audiobooks) [ (As you can see QBQ isn’t there, it is under the Songs section) Here’s how to move it: See my post how to borrow audiobooks from the library and listen to them on an iPhone if you don’t know how to get the audiobook onto your phone 1.

Here’s what the dialog looks like when you have multiple files selected: After you click OK, the track(s) will no longer appear in the Music section in iTunes 3. Go to your phone. Open the Music app. Click on More, then Audiobooks. Your book should now appear. If it doesn’t then try going back to iTunes and doing a sync.

I’ve been out a few times, but I usually enjoy the trip out more than the island itself. There are a few ways to get there from Seattle. Not all of them are well known, so I thought I’d do a post to help you narrow down your options. While in Victoria… Stay at Parkside Victoria Resort &amp; Spa. It is reasonably priced, full kitchens, only a few blocks from the port, free wifi, rooms are very clean, spacious and the pool and hot tub are very nice. The only downside is that they don’t have AC. You can park on the street for free if you get there after 6pm and leave before 10am. Bring the kids to the Beacon Hill Children’s Farm. Great little petting zoo for toddlers. Get some ice cream at The Soda Shoppe Walk the harbor at night to see the art and listen to the buskers. Go to Butchart Gardens…if you like gardens, there’s nothing like this one. Visit the other museums that interest you. Getting to Victoria You really have to consider two options for getting to Victoria: 1) Victoria Clipper or 2) State Ferries + Black Ball Ferry Line. With either option I recommend that you make reservations through their website and show up about an hour before departure time. The lines can get very long. If you want to get there fast, travel light and don’t need your own car, then take the Victoria Clipper. No question. It’s only a 2 hour crossing. Victoria Clipper is a passenger only vessel, no automobiles allowed. On the other hand, if you want to take your time getting there or want to take your own car then the State Ferries + Black Ball Ferry Line is the way to go. While you are on your way out there there are few Washington State things that you should try to experience the: Seattle Skyline Olympic Mountains San Juan Islands You’ll experience all off them very quickly on the Victoria Clipper, but you’ll have time to really soak it all in if you take the state ferries. My Recommendation I recommend taking Anacortes to Sidney on the way there to get the experience of going through the San Juan Islands and then take the Victoria to Port Angeles ferry, via the Black Ball Ferry Line, on the way back to experience the amazing views of the Olympic Mountains. While in Port Angeles stop at: Hurricane Ridge – Drive to the top, bring your own food and have a picnic. Lake Crescent – Go out on the dock at Lake Crescent Lodge. Then drive from Port Angeles to Graysmarsh Farm in Sequim to pick your own berries – a very good u-pick farm. Then drive to the Bainbridge Island ferry dock and take the ferry to Seattle to experience the Seattle Skyline. The major stops on the route will look like this: Seattle to Anacortes to Sidney to Victoria to Port Angeles to Bainbridge Island to Seattle. That is the route I would recommend, especially for first timers who have never experienced the trip out to Victoria. It’s a great route to experience the Puget Sound, the Olympic Peninsula, the San Juan Islands and Victoria. You can see what you like and revisit places you really liked in the future. Other Options There are 4 options for getting to Victoria: Port Angeles Ferry – Great view of Olympics Anacortes Ferry – Great view of San Juan Islands Vancouver Ferry – I haven’t been on this one, but is does look like you get a good run through Mayne Island. Victoria Clipper – Fast, but passengers only, no vehicles. 1. Port Angeles Ferry This ferry ride gives you an amazing view of the Olympic mountains, but you need to take a ferry from Seattle to the Olympic Peninsula first (all options are below)…or you can drive down around through Tacoma. Washington State Ferries will get you to the Olympic Peninsula and then Black Ball Ferry Line will get you from Port Angeles to Victoria. a) Seattle to Bainbridge Island – 4hrs 20mins **** RECOMMENDED** b) Edmonds to Kingston – 4hrs 20mins – Nice, but no Seattle Skyline c) Seattle to Mukilteo to Clinton then Coupeville to Port Townsend – 5hrs 18mins – Not sure why you’d want to do this route, but it is an option. d) Seattle to Bremerton – 5hrs 5mins – Nothing to see down in Bremerton, but it is an option. e) Through Tacoma – 4hrs 30mins – If you don’t want to take a ferry. It’s about the same amount of elapsed time to taking a ferry. I’d rather take a ferry most of the time. 2. Anacortes Ferry If you have never been on a San Juan ferry then you should take this route. It is a great experience to sail through the islands. One of the routes has a stop in Friday Harbor, but you don’t get off the boat. You should try to get the non-stop route to save 30 mins. Take another trip to Friday Harbor someday. Anacortes to Sidney** – 6hrs – ** RECOMMENDED** 3. Victoria Clipper The Victoria Clipper is a very appealing option because it is a lot faster than the state ferries, but you can’t take your own car. So if you are like me and have small children, this option might be more difficult. We don’t travel light so we dreaded the thought of having to carry all our bags from the Victoria Clipper parking lot to the boat. Bags, car seat, stroller, etc…it’s a lot to lug around Seattle and Victoria. This is a great option if you can travel light. You can rent a car there if you need one or you could take a bus to any of the attractions you want to go to. 4. Vancouver, BC Ferry This option is best if you are already headed up to Vancouver or starting your trip from north of Seattle. You can get all the rates and schedules from the BC Ferry site. Through Vancouver – 6.5hrs There are all your options for getting from Seattle to Victoria. I really hope this post was helpful and saved you some time researching your options. Let me know how it turns out.

Read more about it here: Unstar All Google Reader™ Starred Items with my new Chrome™ Extension I’ve been starring Google Reader items for years and noticed yesterday that I had thousands of them starred…some from 2010…I’m never going to read those posts and want start with a clean starred items page. Google Reader doesn’t have an “unstar all” feature. So instead of clicking thousands of times, I wrote a little JavaScript to do that for me. Hope it saves you some time as well. 1. Go to Google Reader and click on the “Starred Items” navigation item in the left column. 2. Make sure all your starred items have been fetched from the server. You can load all items by scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the page or by hitting the “End” key on your keyboard. When you get to the bottom of the page you’ll see a little loading icon in the lower right hand corner that looks like this: Repeat the scrolling until all items appear – you won’t see the loading icon anymore when all items have been loaded. We do this so all items are in the DOM and we can then act upon them with JavaScript. (I might think about scripting this someday, but I don’t have time right now) Once you have scrolled all items into view then you can move on step 3. 3. Copy the “Unstar All” script below into the Console tab of your browsers development tools and hit enter or hit the Run script button (depending on your browser, detailed instructions for each browser are below). var x = document.getElementsByClassName('entry-icons'); for(var i=0;i&amp;lt;x.length;i++)x[i].firstChild.click(); 4. After you execute the script all of the star icons will be grey. Refresh the page by holding down CTRL and clicking on the refresh button or close your browser and reopen to clear the cache. 5. After you refresh your page you won’t have any starred items. If you still do then you didn’t have all the starred items downloaded to the page. See step 2 above and execute the script again. Detailed Instructions IE9 1. Hit F12 2. Click on the Console Tab 3. Copy the script above into the input box. 4. Click the Run Script button. Google Chrome 1. Hit F12 2. Click on the Console Tab 3. Copy the script above into the input box. 4. Hit Enter. FireFox 1. Hit CTRL+SHFT+K or select Web Developer –&gt; Web Console from the main menu. 3. Copy the script above into the input box. 4.

I was getting close to my 2GB limit this month, so turned off my 3G and Cellular Data. [![photo (1) (yes, my SSID is Willie, affectionately named after Willie Nelson) My billing cycle started today so when I checked my data usage I was very surprised to see 21.25MB used. [ I called AT&amp;T. They said that data usage doesn’t always post on the same day that it was used. The 21.25MB was used yesterday on 6/24/2012 (I had to turn it on for a minute to look up an address). That charge should have been billed to my previous billing cycle, but because of the delay in posting the usage to my account it appeared in my current cycle. I consider this double billing, because I paid for 2GB worth of data for my last AND current cycle. That 21.25MB was already paid for last month, now I’m going to have to pay for it again this month. This is obviously a result of a bug in the AT&amp;T billing software. AT&amp;T was very sorry that this happened and asked if a $10 credit would resolve the issue. I took the credit and I’m now happy, BUT this could happen to you as well. Imagine if it was a full gig of data that got delay posted, you’d run out early have have to pay the extra $10 for another gig. I’m hoping they fix this bug, but here’s what I recommend you do every month to make sure you aren’t being double billed for data. 1. Turn off 3G and Cellular data the night before your new billing cycle starts. Go to Settings –&gt; General –&gt; Network and turn off “Enable 3G” and “Cellular data”. Keep it off all night so you are sure no apps are using data in the background. You can find out when your new billing cycle starts by calling AT&amp;T (dial 611), the myAT&amp;T app or the AT&amp;T website. 2. In the morning go to the myAT&amp;T app or the AT&amp;T website and check your data usage. 3. If your data usage isn’t 0MB then call AT&amp;T (1-800-331-0500) and ask them for a credit. UPDATE 6/26/2012 A good friend of mine pointed out that double billing is actually in their wireless customer agreement, they just call it “Delayed Billing”. You can see the full agreement here: AT&amp;T Wireless Customer Agreement and I’ve copied the relevant section below. _Delayed Billing: Billing of usage for calls, messages, data or other Services (such as usage when roaming on other carriers’ networks, including internationally) may occasionally be delayed. Such usage charges may appear in a later billing cycle, will be deducted from Anytime monthly minutes or other Services allotments for the month when the usage is actually billed, and may result in additional charges for that month. _ For anyone that doesn’t see how this is considered double billing: I prepay $25 for 2GB of data for a period of time, in this case one month. Data usage during that period of time is deducted from that 2GB. (I just pre-paid for it once. Even if I didn’t use it I still paid for it.) Data used during that period that isn’t billed until next period is deducted from my next billing cycle. (I just paid for it twice). The data usage doesn’t appear twice on your invoice, so it doesn’t first look like it is double billing, but you are being doubled billed for something, whether it is pre-paid or not, when you pay for it twice. Even if it is in the form of a prepayment. It’s not a big deal in this specific case, because it was only 21.25MB that got billed twice. But imagine if it was 1GB. I would be starting my next billing cycle with only 1GB left. I recommend keeping an eye on your data usage using the AT&amp;T website or the myAT&amp;T app just to make sure you don’t have any surprises. If you are like me and you see double billing occurring then you’ll give them a call.

There is no way to do that with TFS 2010 by using the UI or the object model because both of those methods execute validation rules and you can’t disable them. I heard that you can bypass them in TFS 2012 using the object model, but with TFS 2010 you have to use the WorkItemServer.Update method and pass in the values in an xml package with BypassRules set to true. Most people will first try to set the property directly using the object model like this: item.CreatedDate = date; But you get the error: “The property ‘Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.WorkItem.CreatedDate’ has no setter” OR “Property or indexer ‘Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.WorkItem.CreatedDate’ cannot be assigned to – it is read only” Then you’ll try to bypass the build time error by setting the property using the Fields name value pair by doing something like this: item.Fields[\"System.CreatedDate\"].Value = date.ToString() But you get the “InvalidNotOldValue” validation error when calling Validate() and “TF237124: Work Item is not ready to save” So the only way to do this with TFS 2010 is to bypass the validation rules using the WorkItemServer.Update method. Here’s how you do that: 1.

As you can see it was still being referenced in the Layout…which is why I couldn’t delete it from the field list. 3. Either change or remove that control from Layout. In my case I changed it to MSN.LSE.ITR rather than deleting and recreating the control. 4. Go back to the Fields tab. 5. Select the field you want to delete and click the Delete button from the toolbar. It should delete the field now.

Read on to learn how to overcome this and create SEO friendly urls with Blogger. Fact #1: Search engines match words contained within your urls with keywords users enter into searches. For example, if a user enters “smoked salmon recipe”, your page will rank higher if your url is something like “/smoked-salmon-recipe.html”. Your url is more SEO friendly if it contains those keywords. Fact #2: Blogger only allows 39 characters in url names and creates the url when you publish the blog post for the first time. Fact #3: You cannot change a Blogger url after it has been published. You must delete the post and try again. You could have a beautifully long and descriptive title like “how to cook the most fabulous smoked salmon you’ll ever taste.” and upon first save Blogger will create the following page name for you “/how-to-cook-the-most-fabulous-smoked.html”. As you can see the url is missing your main keyword: salmon. Not good. Here’s how to create SEO friendly URLs the right way: 1. Determine what keywords are most important for your post. In my example, the keywords are “best smoked salmon recipe”. 2. Create a new post and enter those keywords in a way that limits the full string to 39 characters (the max amount of characters that Blogger allows). You can use WordCounter.net to determine the exact length of your string. In my case, my string “best smoked salmon recipe” is only 25 characters, so we are in good shape. Blogger will convert spaces to hyphens and will trim words like “the”, “a” and “and”. So play with it a bit until you find the exact url you want. Start with the fewest most descriptive keyword string and see if it works for you by following step 3… 3. Enter the short post title “best smoked salmon recipe”. Enter the post content. Click Publish. 4. Verify that the url is exactly how you want it. If not, then you need to delete the post and try a different short title. Be careful doing this though because once you create another title that is similar to the original Blogger may tack on an integer to the end and it will look pretty ugly. For example, it might look something like: “/best-smoked-salmon-recipe_30.html”. 5. Update the post title to the long version of the title: “How to cook the most fabulous smoked salmon you’ll ever taste.”. Click Publish. 6. Make sure your FeedBurner feed is refreshed with the long title. See my “Solution to FeedBurner being out of sync with feed, FeedBurner Ping Service” post for more details. There you have it. A SEO friendly Blogger url and a post with a long descriptive title.

I tried the gym for a year, but got really bored with the treadmill, elliptical, weights, etc. Too much repetition and distraction for me. Plus it’s about a 10 minute drive to the gym. I’d rather use that time exercising. I tried Crossfit, but it was too intense and pricey for my blood ($100/month). I decided to go back to the basics: pushups, pullups, situps and running. This post will focus on how I (a non runner) am now training for a 5K (3.1 mile) run. I’ve been doing pushups, pullups and situps for the past 6 months, but wasn’t getting enough cardio. I figured I’d do some jumping jacks, but that is hard to do at 5am when everyone else is sleeping. I didn’t set out to start run training, but as I was browsing through the Health and Fitness section of the App Store last weekend I happened to see a Couch to 5K app and figured I’d give it a try. Couch to 5K training takes you from sitting on the couch to being able to run a 5K. Each session lasts about 30 minutes and you do it 3 times a week for 8 weeks or so. You start with a 5 minute warm up then you alternate between running and walking for 20 minutes then you cool down for 5 minutes. Over the training period you walk less and run more until you are running the full 30 minutes. That is exactly the “ease into it” type of plan I like. CrossFit was too intense from the first second….kind of shocked my body. Couch to 5K will let me ease into cardio at a very doable pace. I downloaded all of the free Couch to 5K and run training apps I could find and discovered that the following four things are important to me: Voice Prompts: I need the app to tell me when to start running and then switch to walking Music: I need to be able to listen to music, audiobooks, etc while I’m running GPS: I need to be able to know exactly how far I ran (2.3 miles vs 3.1 miles) and having the actual route I ran on a map is a bonus. Future: I want to be able to train for a 10k, Half Marathon and Full Marathon if I want to in the future. Everyone that knows me knows that I’m “frugal”. So being myself I wanted to do this for free. After trying out all the free apps I couldn’t find one that met all my needs (the 4 things above) so I resorted to using two apps at the same time. There may be better apps out there, because I didn’t even try the ones that weren’t free. Here are the apps I finally ended up deciding to use: **1. **C25KTM – 5K Trainer FREE – Couch to 5K ](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-4NNxgztuqs4/T8tvWFQnBKI/AAAAAAAACCk/DIfyPENUP5Y/s1600-h/image%255B15%255D.png) ](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-qVKf83x6V74/T8tvW5Mrr3I/AAAAAAAACC0/88LruV0qzIw/s1600-h/image%255B3%255D.png) This is the main training app that I use. I picked this app for the following reasons: Voice Prompts: It has the voice prompts that tell me when to start running and tells me when to start walking. The voice is loud, clear and not annoying (yet) Music: Like all the other ones I tried It allows you to play a playlist while you are walking. You could also just play music outside of the app using Spotify or your favorite music app. Future: ZenLabs (the creator of this app) also has training apps for 10K, Half Marathon and Full Marathon. This is very appealing to me because I know that when I finish my 5K training I’ll want to keep going. They don’t have free versions of the Half and Full Marathon, but that’s okay I’m many months away from getting there. The cons to this app are: It doesn’t save your history to the cloud. If you reset your phone you have to go back and double click each of the days to catch yourself up to where you left off. Not a big deal, but it would be great if they implemented a simple sync with some service. It doesn’t have GPS tracking so you don’t know how long and the distance of your run. I solved this by also using the free GPS app below. This app also supports PINK. You can find out more at exerciseforpink.com **2. **MapMyRun GPS Running ](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uo1O2uzwy6o/T8tvYXHTG2I/AAAAAAAACDU/Qy7DbSFFlEY/s1600-h/image%255B7%255D.png) I only use this app for GPS tracking so I know the exact time and distance of each run. It also saves the route details so you can later view on a map. I also like being able to see the exact distance I ran and also like being able to go the MapMyRun site to see my runs from my laptop. This app also has training plans, but they start at $5.99 a month. You can find out more at mapmyrun.com So every morning that I’m doing a run I start GPS tracking with MapMyRun, then open C25K, start my music then start my workout. I start my second week tomorrow. I’m really enjoying it so far.

When I click on the original button for that image the image looks better and the dimensions are better, but still not 100% accurate. It should be 292x211, but instead it is 296x215.

It’s really easy to do with a Kindle because Amazon.com uses whispernet to wirelessly sync the books with your Kindle…no cable required like with the Nook. (See my other post for an in depth comparison between the Kindle and the Nook 1. Go to your library’s website. Mine is: http://www.kcls.org. Get an account if you don’t already have one. 2. Find the link to the digital library. KCLS (King County Library System) uses OverDrive and your library most likely does as well. I find the KCLS OverDrive site by scrolling down and clicking on the “Downloads” link. 3. After you click Downloads click the &quot;Browse OverDrive eBooks&quot; 4. The best way to find Kindle books is to click the Advanced Search link in the upper right hand corner 5. On the Advanced Search form select Kindle books in the Format dropdown and enter your search criteria. For this post I searched for ‘leadership’ in the title and selected English as the Language. I also checked the “Only show titles with copies available” checkbox so it only returns book that I can immediately checkout. 6. That search returned a bunch of good books, but for this post I’m going to choose &quot;Bo’s Lasting Lessons&quot; a great book. 7. Click on the “add to bag” link to the right of the Kindle Book icon. 8. That redirects you to the Book Bag page 9. From there you can either add other books to your book bag or you can checkout. Click on the “Proceed to Checkout” link to send the book to your Kindle. 10. That will take you to the Sign In page. Enter your library card information and click Sign In. 11. After you sign in you’ll be redirected to the Check Out page. Click “Confirm Check Out”. Notice that the Lending Period says 21 days. You can either change that to another period or just leave as is depending on how long you want to borrow the book. 12. You’ll then be redirected to this confirmation page that links to Amazon.com. Click on the “Get for Kindle” link. 13. That will redirect you to Amazon.com 15. On the right side of the page you select the Kindle (or other device) that you want to send it to and then click &quot;Get Library Book&quot; 16. You’ll then get a confirmation page where you can also download the book locally if you want to manually transfer. Then go to your Kindle and your book will be there. There’s a lot of steps above, but it’s pretty quick once you do it a couple of times. Any one in King County can also get a Seattle Public Library card as well as KCLS. Their direct OverDrive URL is : http://spl.lib.overdrive.com/ You can also check with your employer to see if they have an OverDrive account as well. I now use three different sites to find free library books, KCLS, Seattle Public Library and the Microsoft Library. Hope this helped you figure out how to borrow Kindle books from your library.

I bought them both with my own money and spent a lot of time reading with both of them. I couldn’t decide in the store because the demo apps that are preloaded on the devices don’t really give you a good feel for how the experience will be as you are reading. I knew the decision was going to be a big one because I will invest thousands of dollars in books over the years and the book formats aren’t compatible. It was worth spending a little more money now to try them both out at length and make an educated decision based on my experience. I had never held an eReader before I picked up a Nook at the local B&amp;N store. I didn’t realize it wasn’t backlit, meaning it is just like a normal book. You need a light to read it. (See my blog post for which light I recommend) That was pretty annoying, but then I remembered reading on my iPhone and getting eye fatigue from staring at the backlit screen for so long. Having used an iPhone, Android and Windows Phone for years I was really appalled by the “touch” experience of the Nook. It was very slow to respond and there isn’t immediate feedback like there is on a modern touch interface. I liked the icon based navigation, but couldn’t see myself putting up with a UX that wasn’t responsive like my other devices. Then I checked out the Kindle Touch and soon realized that all eReaders have the same touch experience. I liked the navigation model of the Nook better so I was leaning towards that, but there were other features that were missing and I didn’t know if they’d be important to me or not. At that point I decided that I wouldn’t buy an eReader. The plan was to try out an iPad and see if my eyes could deal with the backlit screen while reading for hours. It didn’t work. My eyes fatigued after reading on an iPad for 10 minutes. I, like most readers, read for hours at a time so that wasn’t going to work. Plus I read in bed on my side and with a backlit screen I need to wear glasses, which doesn’t work when I’m on my side with my head in my pillow. The iPad is also too big for me to hold while I’m on my side. So, I returned the iPad and decided to try out both the Kindle Touch and the Nook Simple Touch to see which one I liked better. Actually, I had to decided which one I didn’t like the least, because I don’t really like either of them. It’s a choice between the lesser of two evils. There is no perfect eReader out there, so be ready to make some tradeoffs. Here are my thoughts on the tradeoffs of each. Very Important Features - These are make or break features for me. I put them in a category of their own because these were ultimately the features that lead to me choosing the Kindle over the Nook. Nook doesn’t always recognize taps. Kindle is better. * For some reason when I am lying down and using the Nook it doesn't always recognize my taps. I have to tap two or three times and then it might jump ahead a few pages or a chapter and then I'm completely lost and have to go back to table of contents or hit back a couple of times until some of the text looks familiar. This was VERY annoying and a deal breaker for me. With an eReader I expect the reading experience to be top notch. The Kindle has a better reading experience than the Nook. &lt;li&gt;Although the Kindle doesn't always recognize taps I think it is my fault most of the time. Sometimes I don't touch the screen hard enough or I'm too tired and hit the wrong place on the screen. Nook’s tap zones are too small. Kindle’s are bigger * This is hard one to describe with words only so I included a graphic below. The Nook has three columns. The left goes back a page, the center goes to the menu and the right goes next. The problem is that the left and right columns are so narrow that you end up hitting the center column often, which opens the menu, which you have to tap again to close the menu and then tap again to go to the next or previous page. But this time when you tap you have to position your finger sideways so you are sure it doesn't hit the center column. This again is very annoying. &lt;li&gt;The Kindle tap zones are much better. There are only two columns, next and previous and there's plenty of space for both operations. &lt;li&gt;Both the Kindle and the Nook have an area in the top right corner of the screen to add a bookmark. This space is too small on both of them. You end up having to twist your finger to the very tip and hope you don't hit the next page zone.![](/images/blog/7041.image_5F00_thumb_5F00_76174219.png) Important Features – These are important features, but not important enough for me to make a decision based on these features alone. Kindle supports audio books. Nook doesn’t. * Even if you don't listen to audio books now, what if you someday wanted to? Impossible with the Nook. Kindle has a Windows Phone app. Nook doesn’t. * I have all types of phones and I need my books with me on all my phones. Kindles library experience uses Whispernet…the wireless sync technology. The Nook requires you to download a file and plug in a cable to transfer the book to your Nook. * I absolutely hate having to plug my eReader into my computer to get a book on to it. Nook uses ePub for library books and yes there are more ePub library books than Kindle Format books, but just the thought of having to plug in my Nook bothers me. You have to use Adobe software to do the transfer, which is yet another piece of software that you don't need when you use the Kindle &lt;li&gt;The Kindle experience is awesome. First, you check the book out from your libraries website. It then takes you to Amazon.com where you confirm it and choose which device you want to send it to. It's a very smooth experience. Kindle doesn’t have physical next and previous buttons. Nook does. * I know this might sound like a negative for the Kindle, but the Nook physical buttons require too much pressure to push while you are reading because your hands don't comfortably sit on those physical buttons for extended periods of time. You have to grip the Nook with both hands to press the buttons. A pain when you are lying on your side. Kindle has a web browser. Nook doesn’t. * Although the internet browsing experience is pretty awful on the Kindle it is nice to know that it is there if I ever want it. The Nook doesn't have one. Nook has a more modern interface. Kindle doesn’t * I compare the two to Windows versions. Kindle is like Windows 95 and Nook is like Windows 98\\. Both are still pretty bad, but Nook is better. It uses icons, whereas the Kindle uses menus. I dread having to go into the Kindle menus. I have to read them every time I want to find something. With the Nook it is just intuitive icons that are easy to remember and they don't change. With the Kindle you never know what to expect in the menu options because they change based on the context. &lt;li&gt;That is…everything leading up to the reading experience is better than the Kindle. The way you search books, the way you find bookmarks, the way you take notes all of those features are better on the Nook. But because of my &quot;reading&quot; experience, as I noted above all of the Nook UI niceties don't matter. First priority is having a great reading experience, which the Kindle is better at. Kindle has X-Ray. Nook doesn’t. * X-ray is a very cool feature of the Kindle. It analyzes your book and picks out all the important nouns and gives you further information about them. For example, you can research all the places and people that are mentioned in the book. [You can check it out here](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2011/09/30/the-kindle-changes-books-again-with-kindle-x-ray/) Nook doesn’t have special offers. Kindle does. * This could be annoying for some people, but it doesn't bother me. I actually like the special offers that are presented. It actually beats the Nook screen savers which is pretty much the same thing all the time. &lt;li&gt; Kindle feels more solid than the Nook * When holding the Kindle it almost feels like a sturdy metal whereas the Nook feels like a softer plastic. I have dropped the Kindle a few times and I'm not sure the Nook could withstand the stuff that the Kindle has been through…like my kid throwing it down a flight a stairs &lt;li&gt;I also don't like the almost felt like feeling of the Nook. I like the smooth texture of the Kindle better. To sum my experience here is what I recommend: Buy a Kindle if you… Want the better in-book reading experience Ever want to listen to audiobooks Want to easily get library books on your Kindle Ever want to browse the internet on your eReader Buy a Nook if you… Want to get very frustrated with the in-book reading experience, but like a better experience leading up to reading (searching, finding a book, etc) Hate advertisements and don’t want to spend the extra money to get the Kindle without special offers. Want physical next/previous buttons (see note above why this doesn’t matter to me)I mulled over this decision for many months, but finally decided to stick with the Kindle. I just couldn’t get over the better in-book reading experience and the frustration I felt when using the Nook. I hope this helps you decide which eReader to purchase.

It’s compact enough to quickly throw in your pocket. Also, when reading while lying down you can use it to prop up your Kindle on its side. All those clip on lights with the adjustable arms are pretty annoying, especially if you want to quickly throw it into your pocket. You also have to move that arm around all the while you are reading because it gets in the way. According to the manufacturers site you can get them at Office Depot, Target and the Container Store.

I then realized I missed a column and wanted to add another sort column to all those queries. I made the changes to one of the other 10 queries and thought there must be a way to do this without having to click a thousand times using the TFS UI. The TFS SDK lets you update queries, so I just grab the select columns and the sort columns from the source query (the first one I modified) and then replaced those fields the destination queries. It’s pretty simple, but worth a quick post and will hopefully save you thousands of clicks as well. You probably need to be a project admin for this to work. Ask your TFS admin to give you those perms. 1. Open a new console app. 2. Reference Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client and Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client 3.

I don’t have the source for every version of this DLL so I needed a way to convert it to C# files and diff those. Since there are thousands of versions of this file out there I needed to be able to generate the C# files programmatically. I started with Reflector, but it doesn’t have a simple API needed to generate the files programmatically. I came across [JustDecompile](http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx. from Telerik and found that they do have a command line API that works great. I could have just invoked the EXE with Process.Start, but I figured I should see how they are doing and see if I could do everything inproc. So I decompiled the JustDecompile.exe file and found a very simple DLL method that they use to output C# files. 1. Download JustDecompile 2. Open up your project and Add References to these two DLLs. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telerik\\JustDecompile\\Libraries\\JustDecompile.Tools.MSBuildProjectBuilder.dllC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Telerik\\JustDecompile\\Libraries\\JustDecompiler.dll 3. Add the following namespaces: using JustDecompile.Tools.MSBuildProjectBuilder; using Telerik.JustDecompiler.Languages.CSharp; using System.Threading; 4. Add this code to your project where you want to programmatically decompile code MSBuildProjectBuilder projectBuilder = new MSBuildProjectBuilder([path to dll], outfolder, new CSharpV4());projectBuilder.ProjectFileCreated += new EventHandler&lt;ProjectFileCreatedEvent&gt;(projectBuilder_ProjectFileCreated);&lt;/ProjectFileCreatedEvent&gt;projectBuilder.BuildProject(new CancellationToken()); Where [path to dll] is the path to the dll that you want to decompile and outfolder is the folder you want to output the C# files. 5. Add this event handler to be notified when the Visual Studio Project file has been created static void projectBuilder_ProjectFileCreated(object sender, ProjectFileCreatedEvent e)&#123; //throw new NotImplementedException();&#125; Hope this saves you some time.

I like the mouse, but not enough to shell out that kind of dough. So, after 10+ years of using the same mouse (my friends call it a relic) I had to find a replacement. I decided on the Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman mouse. While it is not as comfortable as the Microsoft Trackball Explorer it is close enough and only about $50. Since I do the un-human thing and work at a computer all day I have to optimize the amount of clicking and typing I do. I also have a repetitive stress injury from playing too much bass in high school that flares up if I spend too much time clicking. So, to limit the amount of clicks I do, I have configured one of the buttons on my mouse to execute a double-click command. It issues a double click to my computer, but I only have to click it once. It has saved me a ton of clicks over the years so I thought I’d share how I do that and possibly save you from a repetitive stress injury. For the Microsoft Trackball Explorer it’s easy. You just go into the mouse properties and set the top left button to Double-click. But for the Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman that option doesn’t exist. The only option for the top left button is right click. After doing a couple of searches I discovered the X-Mouse Button Control application. It’s a great little utility lets you override all your mouse buttons. It lets me override the “right button” which maps to the “top” button on my Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman When you are using this application you should be aware that you can turn all its overrides off by checking the box: “Bypass ALL Actions when SCROLL LOCK is ON”. This is very important if you are using a laptop, because when the mouse isn’t connected it will still override the right click behavior on your laptop’s mouse pad. Another thing that took me a while to figure out is how to map the 4 &amp; 5 buttons (those are the two buttons on the left side of the mouse above the left click (big) button)…which I use for “right-click” and “show desktop”. The trick is that you have to set 4 &amp; 5 to “Generic Button” in Logitech SetPoint and then in X-Mouse Button Control you use “Mouse Button 4” and “Mouse Button 5” to set them to whatever you want. You have to do this because SetPoint doesn’t allow you to configure those buttons to anything. They limit you to what they think is best. Hope this helps you configure your mouse and save you some clicks.

While I’m really happy with the quality of the recordings there are some significant design flaws that prevent it from reaching its full potential. I have sent these issues to Zoom directly and they informed me that they have no plans to fix these problems, but will forward to the developers. My overall workaround for the problems below is to: Use a Class 6 16GB or larger SDHC Card Stop recording, check Levels and then re-start recording after each song is recorded **There’s No Hardware Based File Divider Function **There’s no easy way to divide a recording into separate files while recording. The result is that you have to start and stop recording while rehearsing to get your songs onto separate files or you have to do more post-processing to extract the songs individually. It does support BWF markers, but only when you are recording WAV files, which is overkill for rehearsal recordings. I’ve heard that Reaper, Sound Forge and Adobe Audition support splitting (surprisingly the included software Cubase LE does not) on BWF markers but I haven’t tried because of the Max File Size limitation (below). The easiest way to fix this is with a firmware update that allows users to override the default behavior of pressing the Record button while recording, which sets a BWF marker, to instead divide the file at that point. Even my cheap Sony Digital Voice Recorder has this function. **It Pauses Recording When the Max File Size is Reached **The H4n has a max file size of 2GB. If you hit that limit while recording it will pause recording, write the file to disk and then start recording again. The result is that you have a brief pause in the recording. I’m not how long the pause is, but it doesn’t matter because it shouldn’t pause at all. This is really bad if this happens in the middle of a song. This is my biggest disappointment with the device. It’s a basic feature that every other field recorder that I’ve used includes. My workaround for this is to stop recording every 30 mins or so, let the file write to disk, hit record button to set levels and then start recording. It only takes about 3 minutes or so, but I shouldn’t have to do that. This is a harder fix for them, but still a firmware fix. **It Only Supports 2 Channels in Audio Interface Mode **I want to be able to record all 4 Channels directly to my laptop, but Audio Interface Mode only supports 2 channels. This is definitely something they should include in their marketing materials. This is a serious limitation in my opinion. This may require a hardware change, but should really only be a firmware fix as well. **The Recommended 32GB SDHC Card Isn’t Available **The Supported SD Card List has the Toshiba SD-C32GT4 32GB but that card doesn’t exist anymore. I asked Samson and Zoom and they have no recommendation for an alternative. The suggested going with something from SanDisk, Toshiba, Transcend and that the “list” isn’t definitive. When you do get a card, make sure it is a Class 6 card. There are some reports online of Class 2 and Class 4 not working as well in the H4n. I decided on the Patriot SDHC 16GB Class 6 card and it seems to work fine. Hopes this helps you in your research for finding the perfect field recorder.

DeviceAtlas – Great for .NET solutions, but it’s starts at $99/server/year. DeviceAtlas claims to have better UAProf support than WURFL. To solve this problem Microsoft developed an ASP.NET friendly browser detection solution using a standard “.browser” file called “Mobile Device Browser File” or MDBF. This is the same solution that is being utilized by many Microsoft properties such as Hotmail. Chris Woods (the MDBF PM) gave a talk at MIX09 on the new project, view the video here:. The data for MDBF comes from WURFL and “other sources”. I hope Microsoft contributes back to WURFL since they have direct access to providers they will have a ton of insight into new devices and capabilities that non-.NET platforms utilizing WURFL will benefit from.

When you drag a database object to the dbml file an app.config file is created, but there isn’t an option anywhere in properties to actually use it. We really don’t want to have to manage connection strings in multiple places and when dev’n a class library it’s usually best to leave that up to the client of the class library especially if you own dev of both projects. (not considering service interface here) Here’s what I recommend to simplify the connection string management, Create the dbml file in the class library project and drag a database object onto the design surface. Find the default parameterless ctor for the DataContext something like this and remove it. ` public DataClasses1DataContext() : base(global::LINQConnStringLib.Properties.Settings.Default.ConnectionString, mappingSource) { OnCreated(); } ` 3) Add a reference to the System.Configuration DLL. 4) Create a new CS file to hold the Data Context partial class that will contain the default ctor and the following code to it (replacing class name and conn string name for your project)` ` `public partial class DataClasses1DataContext` ` ` `{` ` public DataClasses1DataContext() : base (ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"ConnectionString\"].ConnectionString) { OnCreated(); } }` 5) Add the connection string to your application configuration file.` ` `&lt;configuration&gt;` ` ` `&lt;connectionStrings&gt;` ` ` `&lt;add name=\"ConnectionString\"` ` ` `connectionString=\"x\"` ` ` `providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt;` ` ` `&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;` ` ` `&lt;/configuration&gt;` 6) Delete the settings file if you don't need it. It will be created again if you add new objects to the dbml file so I just leave it there. 7) Right click on the DBML file design surface and chose properties. Select \"none\" for the Connection property. That way the default ctor won't be created in the generated file. The down side to this approach is that you have to set the Connection property to none after you add new objects to the dbml file, but it's not as bad as having to manage the connection string in multiple places.

Blend 2 creates that VS project using version 2.0 of the .NET Framework. Some symptoms are that the XAML code behind won’t have the controls and InitializeComponent won’t resolve. To work around this you need to create a Blend.exe.config file to redirect the assembly bindings. After you do this, your projects will be created automattically with .NET Frameowrk 3.5. Apply the following (one-time only) workaround to enable projects created in Visual Studio Code Name “Orcas” to be opened with Expression Blend. 1. Close Expression Blend. 2. Navigate to the Expression Blend installation directory typically installed at Program Files\\Microsoft Expression\\Blend 1.1. 3. Create a new XML file in that folder and rename the file to Blend.exe.config. Copy and paste the following XML into that file: &lt;?xml version =\"1.0\"?&gt;&lt;configuration&gt; &lt;startup&gt; &lt;supportedRuntime version=\"v2.0.50727\" safemode=\"true\"/&gt; &lt;requiredRuntime version=\"v2.0.50727\" safemode=\"true\"/&gt; &lt;/startup&gt; &lt;runtime&gt; &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt; &lt;dependentAssembly&gt; &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Build.Framework\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\"/&gt; &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-99.9.9.9\" newVersion=\"3.5.0.0\"/&gt; &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt; &lt;dependentAssembly&gt; &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Build.Engine\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\"/&gt; &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-99.9.9.9\" newVersion=\"3.5.0.0\"/&gt; &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt; &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt; &lt;/runtime&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt; 4. Save the changes to the file and close it. 5. Start Expression Blend. Now you should be able to successfully build your projects and solutions. Note If you uninstall Visual Studio Code Name “Orcas” and the .NET Framework 3.5, you should also delete the Blend.exe.config file.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Bugs","slug":"Tech/Bugs","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Bugs/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Running two different versions of ASP.NET on the same server","slug":"aspnet-two-versions","date":"2007-05-24T14:15:00.000Z","updated":"2016-12-26T00:20:09.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2007/05/aspnet-two-versions/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2007/05/aspnet-two-versions/","excerpt":"","text":"I just installed Orcas and was getting this error when running a performance test: Event Type: Error Event Source: ASP.NET 2.0.50727.0 Event Category: None Event ID: 1062 Date: 5/24/2007 Time: 11:11:12 AM User: N/A Description: It is not possible to run two different versions of ASP.NET in the same IIS process.

BUT… The drawback to using this is that the page will continue to process on the server and be sent to the client. If you are doing a redirect in Page_Init (or like) and call Response.Redirect(url, false) the page will only redirect once the current page is done executing. This means that any server side processing you are performing on that page WILL get executed. In most cases, I will take the exception perf hit over the rendering perf hit, esp since the page won’t be rendered anyway and that page could potentially have a ton of data. Using Fiddler I was also able monitor my http traffic and see that when using this redirect method the page is actually being sent to the client as well. I don’t usually do redirects in try/catch blocks, but if you do the ThreadAbortException will be handled by your catch and potentially cause a transaction Abort (depending on what you are doing of course). If you do put the redirect in the try block, then you’ll need to explicitly catch the ThreadAbortException or create a wrapper method that does that for you.

I came a little late, but caught the cool work ms is doing with ease of integration with Office Addins. VSTO makes this especially easy. He demo’d a cool add in that eBay created for monitoring auctions. Although not an avid eBayer this is something I’ve wanted for a while. The extensibility of the Outlook service layer has improved so building these apps is going to be much easier with 2007. I’ve built a few Outlook addins and this is a much welcomed development. Joe demo’d some Vista gadgets - the Xbox gamer tag and Rss feed gadgets are cool, but what I found most interesting is that ms is going to be providing a gadget discovery application that allows gadget developers to list and people to find and install for free. Find out more out the sidebar and gadgets here. The Vista Windows Media player UI now includes album art in search results - something I’ve also wanted for a long time. The Vista Media center was demo’d. The extensibility of it looks amazing - really geared towards 3rd party developer customization, even at the start menu level. MC is built on top o WPF so you get all the amazing benefits of the foundation with your apps. MC also ships with an SDK with sample code for building the components. Atlas Lessons from the Trenches – Scott Isaacs Use JSON when marshaling data from client to server. SOAP works, but is more difficult to deserialize and much more verbose. Don’t assume client calls always succeed. Have callbacks and a plan for failures. Watch the browser history stack, clients navigate with Atlas and the address bar is not updated, users add to favorites and are right back where they started from. Local live uses permalink, but we need a better way – Live.com tags a hash onto the url and then discovers the page state from that. Cache whenever possible. Handle the OnBeforeUnload event to check for requests that have not been completed and prompt the user to verify that they really want to leave the page before the operation completes. Make use of subdomains for resources such as images, includes files, etc so that the browser connections are free to make AJAX calls. My personal favorite… It’s your customer, not the technology you apply that matters.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Conferences","slug":"Tech/Conferences","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Conferences/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Mix Day 1 Part 2","slug":"mix-day-1-part-2","date":"2006-03-20T19:40:00.000Z","updated":"2016-12-28T07:56:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2006/03/mix-day-1-part-2/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2006/03/mix-day-1-part-2/","excerpt":"","text":"**Overview of Expression - Brad Becker **Splitview and XamlPad are included in the WinFx SDK. You can use them to create the Xaml by hand, but I would stay away if you can and go with Expression! It is way too verbose to be editing by hand. Expression allows you to design the application like you would with any graphics program and open that same project in VS. Cool thing about Expression is that it is built on top of WPF so it utilizes all the dynamic positioning an resizing made available for free. Definitely check out the Expression demos on ms.com to learn more. **Developing a Better UX with Atlas - Skanku Niyogi **The take aways for me where how easy it is to implement the asyn call pings with the &lt;atlas:Timer control. The ProfileScript and DragOverlay extenders are definitely going to be a big help - and only take a few mins to hookup. Check out the showcased sites here and if you are new to Atlas get started here. Developing a Windows Presentation Foundation Application - Filipe Fortes WinFx includes VS project types and sets up your environment for you, gives you intellisense when coding the Xaml by hand (though I still recommend Expression) and allows you to easily run within IE. One cool aspect of WPF is that you can include your own font files in the project which are shipped with the product. That way you always know that the end user will see the app the same way that you do and the user doesn’t have to download the font if they don’t have it installed locally.

Amazingly enough we work in the same building @ ms, but have never met - it’s cool b/c we both started community projects for developers (him: DotNetJunkies and me: DotNetConnect) before coming to ms and we are both now in the developer focused group. We have plans to collab on some stuff coming up - mostly internal process stuff (unit test checkin policies w/ VSTS and SCM), but it could eventually turn into some new cool dev outreach project. The keynote was great this morning. O’Reilly asked Bill how he was going to manage to compete when products ms ships are on a few year ship cycle. Bill’s response was great. To sum up, it depends on the product type being shipped. Sql and Windows take much longer b/c of the testing and stabilization that needs to happen. Where as IE and Messenger can ship more frequently because they are not a huge product and agile processes can be used to dev them. My group is looking at smaller quarterly releases which work well because of the nature of the product (platform). Bottom line, is it depends, which gets into the whole “which dev process do I use conversation”…agile/scrum work for a lot of projects, but with a project like Sql or Windows it would be extremely risky b/c of size of the product. The WPF demo was great…although I would have like to of seen more code. I’m sure they’ll be more later. For IE7 the features that stuck out for me are the Open Search discovery stuff, tab preview, tab grouping, easy homepage setting, printing (fixed!), print preview (including easy way to change margins) and zooming. Beta 2 Preview was released today, definitely install and check these features out… Security wise InfoCard looks very interesting. It’s a new identity management system that will eventually replace username/password login sites. Client experience wise we dug into Simple List Extensions and how amazon, yahoo and ebay are using to provide a rich feed service for searches, baskets, etc. Lastly Scottgu demo’d his Atlas todo list site from scratch using the newly released build of Atlas. It took him only about 10 mins to create the whole site from scratch. It included inline editing, progress updater and lots of other cool stuff. You can see the full video here. I’ll post more info tonight…I’ve got to go do some xbox’in.","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Conferences","slug":"Tech/Conferences","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Conferences/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Office 12 - What do you think?","slug":"office-12-what-do-you-think","date":"2006-03-16T00:16:00.000Z","updated":"2018-12-10T22:37:38.033Z","comments":true,"path":"2006/03/office-12-what-do-you-think/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2006/03/office-12-what-do-you-think/","excerpt":"","text":"Just installed Office12 yesterday…I know a bit late, but I’ve been working like crazy lately and just starting to get caught back up on what else is happening in this world ;) Wow - it is slick.

I needed to capture the ItemAdd, ItemSend and SelectionChange events, which his was working great on my 2003 server dev box, but when installed on XP they did not fire. I tried many workarounds, but nothing was working, so I posted at OutlookCode.com and Robert Halstead was nice enough to share a work around with me. What you have to do is add the “static” modifier to the variable declaration. It is hard to believe that I could not find this online somewhere and I hope someone with the same issue finds this post. Here is some sample code with the workaround. public class Connect : Object, Extensibility.IDTExtensibility2&#123; private static Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.Items sentFolderItems; public void OnConnection(object application, Extensibility.ext_ConnectMode connectMode, object addInInst, ref System.Array custom) &#123; sentFolderItems = applicationObject.Session.GetDefaultFolder(OlDefaultFolders.olFolderSentMail).Items; sentFolderItems.ItemAdd += new ItemsEvents_ItemAddEventHandler(SentItems_ItemAdd);","categories":[{"name":"Tech","slug":"Tech","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/"},{"name":"Tips","slug":"Tech/Tips","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/category/Tech/Tips/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"VSS Cloaking","slug":"vss-cloaking","date":"2004-10-08T00:01:00.000Z","updated":"2016-12-27T16:00:57.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2004/10/vss-cloaking/","link":"","permalink":"https://blog.jongallant.com/2004/10/vss-cloaking/","excerpt":"","text":"I finally learned what the cloaking feature of VSS does and wanted to share. If you cloak a folder, you are marking it as a folder that you do not want to include in a recursive get. For example, lets say you have this dir structure. $/ Apps (Cloaked) TestCases If you were to do a recursive get from $/, the Apps directory would be excluded from the get. This is very helpful if you want to get latest, but don’t want to get a certain dir, like “Images” for instance. A real time saver in my opinion. How to Cloak: 1. Right click on VSS project 2. Select Properties 3. Check the “project cloaked for me” checkbox.
