            <p>I need motivation to keep physically active. If unchecked I would sit, eat and code all day. Even a little motivation does wonders for my psyche. I use a bunch of apps to keep me motivated with yoga, weight tracking, pushups and running. This post is about my experiment with the latest step counters.</p>
<h2 id="The-Back-Story"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Back-Story"></a>The Back Story</h2>
<p>Back in August I tried the Fitbit Flex and Jawbone UP – I preferred the UP, but I wasn’t completely happy with either of them. I didn’t like the Flex because Fitbit sleep data wasn’t as rich as the UP and I didn’t like the UP because I had to plug it in to sync it. I concluded that experiment wanting the UP with Bluetooth, but it didn’t exist back then.</p>
<p>I ended up just using the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/argus-motion-fitness-tracker/id624329444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argus</a> app. Argus is an iPhone app that runs in the background and counts your steps. It also captures everything that the Fitbit and UP apps capture like activities, weight, food and calories. But my iPhone battery was constantly draining – I could watch the battery percentage decrease by 1% every minute. I thought it was Argus’s fault, so I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>Then Jawbone released the Jawbone UP24 – which includes Bluetooth sync. I figured I would try it out – because my analysis in August led me to wanting an UP with Bluetooth. I thought it would be perfect. I bought a Large. The first thing I noticed is that it’s really big for my wrist. It slips up and down my arm and I’m constantly moving it around. I get a small piece of velcro and stick it to the insides of the UP24, but the velcro glue doesn’t hold up. The UP24 was getting caught on my coat and shirt and I feared losing it. I go back to the store and get an UP24 Medium – but it’s too tight – it feels like it’s cutting off blood flow to my hand. It took me a while to realize it, but the UP24 actually feels like a rubber-coated handcuff. Whichever I choose it has to be comfortable. It’s going to be on my wrist 24x7 and it can’t annoy me.</p>
<p>So, now I’m back to square one. The UP24 Large is too big. The UP24 Medium is too small. I go back to the store and pick up a Fitbit Flex again. The sleep data still isn’t as rich, but if comfort is my first priority then the Flex wins. I wear the Jawbone UP24 and the Flex 24x7 for two weeks straight. I did a couple of simple accuracy tests to see which one is better and the UP24 is definitely more accurate. The Fitbit was always about 12% low. But that wasn’t a strong enough case to go with the UP24.</p>
<p>During that two week period I had had enough with my iPhone battery and stopped by the Genius Bar. It turns out my battery was defective. They swapped it out in 15 mins. It then dawned on my that my previous battery issues weren’t Argus’s fault. I installed Argus again and started tracking my activity with all three: UP24, Flex and Argus.</p>
<p>After a week I ruled out the UP24. The velcro I put on to hold it in place kept coming off, I was anxious about losing it, I felt it there constantly and I couldn’t get the rubber handcuff association out of my head.</p>
<p>Then a few days ago the Flex started bothering me. My hands started to feel swollen – even when the band was very loose – and I started taking it off at night because it bothered me so much.</p>
<p>I’ve only used Argus for the past week, so it might be too soon to tell, but I’m loving it. I’m really getting into what I call unobtrusive quantification – which basically means capturing data without being intentional about it.</p>
<p>The end result of my analysis is that I’m not going to use any of the fitness bands. I want to see how far I can go with measuring without having an extra device on me. I always have my phone on me – so it should work out well. I’ll update this post later on if anything changes.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you figure out which one to go with. Try out Argus first and see if that meets your needs.<br>
Jon</p>
<p>p.s. I didn’t throw the Fitbit Force into the mix because I consider the Flex to be UP24’s main competitor. The Force is in a different category in my opinion.</p>
<p>UPDATE 1/12/2014:</p>
<p>I do not recommend Argus for iPhone 5. It prevents your phone from going into standby mode, which reduces the battery life by a significant amount. Mine would die after about 4 hours of normal usage. I have since upgraded to iPhone 5S. Argus works fine and I have normal battery life. You don’t have to actively run Argus because of the iPhone 5S motion tracker feature.</p>
