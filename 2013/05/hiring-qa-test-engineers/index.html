<p>I recently joined a new team to work on a brand new super-secret Windows 8 Modern app. You may have seen my “<a href="/2013/03/new-job-hiring-devs.html">Moving on to Microsoft Advertising to work on a super secret Win8 app. Come join me.</a>” post back in March. We set out to hire 30 developers and hired a ton of good devs right off the bat.</p>
<p>We recently decided to repurpose a few of those openings to bring on some QA/Test engineers. We need to fill things out a bit and hire some engineers with a QA background that can help us flesh out the test plan and develop some good end-to-end test cases that developers can then go implement. We are starting with 2 openings, one Senior SDET and one SDET II. We are hoping that the Senior SDET can play a broader role in coordinating all-things-test for the team and the SDET II can contribute by implementing those things and help get to closure on proper test case implementation and code coverage.</p>
<p>We are pretty open and flexible to the type of person we hire, but you must be passionate about QA/Test, have a strong track-record of developing test solutions end-to-end and come with a ton of good ideas on how you can cover all-things-test for us.</p>
<p>The job description is below. Read it over and if interested follow these two very important steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply on the official MS site <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/jobdetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=4&amp;jid=109890&amp;jlang=EN&amp;pp=SS" target="_blank" rel="external">Senior SDET</a> (many years under your belt, ready to run the show) or <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/jobdetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=5&amp;jid=110444&amp;jlang=EN&amp;pp=SS" target="_blank" rel="external">SDET II</a> (couple years under your belt. not ready to run the show)  </li><li>Send me a note with a link to your online resume (linkedin, stackoverflow, etc) <a href="/contact">here</a>. Sell yourself. Get my attention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance for applying. I look forward to speaking with everyone.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>You must have be a US/AU Citizen or already have an H1B. I can transfer, but can’t sponsor.</p>
<p>I can’t do remote. I can’t do part-time. You need to relo to Bellevue, WA.</p>

<p>No legacy code. Greenfield Windows 8 app. We are the User Centric Advertising Team and we’re developing a key application combining features of Bing into a truly native experience for Windows. We’ll push the limits of the social graph and machine learning to deliver a world class experience on Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and the Web. We just got the green light from the leadership team to move forward with the project and we now need to hire a team of engineers to go build it. We haven’t fleshed out all the details, but that is a good thing. You can come in and see the project blossom from the ground up and influence the direction of it. One thing we know for sure is that we have the drive and know the product and team are going to be amazing.</p>
<p>We are a tightknit team of engineers that put shipping the product above all other artificial boundaries. Our team members with more feature development background will do most of the feature code and our team members with more of an automation background will do most of the automation development…but you will work together to ship. Mutual ownership at its finest. Most of us on the team haven’t developed Windows 8 applications yet. It would be a plus to have Windows 8 development experience, but not required. We are a bunch of web developers that are experts in building applications using the latest and greatest technologies including MVC, jQuery and a slew of other technologies that other teams rarely get the opportunity to experiment with.</p>
<p>Now that we have hired a bunch of developers we need to augment with a solid strong SDET that understands all the complexities that go into testing a complex Windows 8 application. You will work closely with our TBH Senior SDET to analyze all the scenarios that we are targeting for a given two week sprint, develop all the Test Cases that need to be automated and then hand them off to the SDEs to implement. You’ll also code, just like the rest of the SDEs, but your primary responsibility will be helping us figure out all that needs to be tested and make sure we aren’t missing anything.<br>
You don’t need join a startup to have the startup vibe, come join us and get all the same benefits of a startup culture with the security of all that Microsoft has to offer.</p>
<p>Required Experience:**<br>
**</p>
<ul>
<li>3+ years relevant test experience  </li><li>Fluent in multiple web technologies with hands on experience in many of these areas: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, jQuery, <a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="external">ASP.NET</a>, WebApi, MVC, JSON,  RSS/ATOM  </li><li>Must demonstrate strong skill in C#, VB, Java or C++  </li><li>Understanding of Agile Methodology  </li><li>BS in Computer Science or related field or equivalent experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Pluses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8 Application Development  </li><li>A/B Testing Experience  </li><li>Experience building reliable, large-scale web sites or services  </li><li>Good understanding of web performance and scalability concerns</li>
</ul>
